A,Thank you for calling Triple-A bank.
A,My name is Arianna.
A,May I have your name?
C,James breed; 
A,Oh hello Mr. Breed.
A,How can I make you smile today?
C,Why do I have fees on my bank account? 
C,I want those removed. 
C,Very ridiculous.
C,I can't even afford them.
A,Oh. I understand that fees are really costly. 
A,Let me check your account to see what really happened.
C,Ok and remove the fees
A,I'll see what I can do Mr. Breed. 
A,As I have checked you were charged some fees because you were not able to pay on time so that means we really cannot do anything about it anymore.
C,What do you mean you can't do anything? 
C,You are supposed to help me.
C,Can you at least try to remove the fees?
A,"No, no sir. "
A,I can't do that because you did not make a payment.
C,If you just look at my account I made a payment but it was just a few hours late.
C,Can you at least consider? 
C,I had to look for funds just to make a payment but I did my best to pay on my due date.
C,I was just late for the cutoff.
C,Can you please just remove at least one fee?
A,"As much as I'd love to help you Mr. Breed, my hands are tied right now."
A,There's nothing I can do.
A,I already told you the reason and I'm afraid you'll have to pay the fees you'll have to pay the fees for now.
A,I want to let you know that you can actually avoid these fees by paying before 4 p.m. of your due date.
A,I already know that. 
C,You already explained that.
C,You keep telling me the same thing but you're not doing anything.
C,I will make sure to call back and speak to your supervisor. 
C,You are not helping me at all even though I've been a customer for five years!
C,Terrible service!
A,I'm really really really sorry sir.
C,No. You are not sorry.
A,Thank you for calling Triple-A bank.
A,My name is Maria.
A,May I have your name?
C,James breed; 
A,Oh hello Mr. Breed.
A,How can I make you smile today?
C,Why do I have fees on my bank account?
C,I want those removed.
C, Very ridiculous.
C,I can't even afford them.
A,Oh. I understand that fees are really costly.
A,Let me check your account to see what really happened.
C,Ok.
C,And remove the fees.
A,I'll see what I can do Mr. Breed.
A,"As I have checked, the account was charged some fees because there was no payment made before the cut off time of 4 p.m."
C,I made a payment.
C,I did my best to look for funds so I could pay on my due date.
C,It's just that it was done after 4 p.m.
A,I truly understand what you're going through Mr. Breed.
A,"However, the fees charged were valid and therefore, the fees can no longer be refunded or removed."
C,Like I said I really did my best. Can you please remove even just one fee?
C,I really can't afford it.
C,Maybe you can make a consideration?
C,Please. Besides I made a payment on the due date itself.
A,"I understand your concern sir and as much as I want to remove the fees, they really can no longer be removed."
A,"However, since you requested, okay, I will send a request to the management and it's up to them to decide whatever course of action they will do after reviewing your account but this doesn't guarantee that the fees will be refunded."
C,Okay I understand that it's worth trying though.
C,Thank you for doing that.
A,You're welcome Mr. Breed.
A,I have already submitted a request and you will receive an email or text message after three days for the decision.
C,Thanks for trying.
A,Thank you for calling Shapes Reward.
A,My name is Mathilda.
A,Can I have your name please?
C,This is ELISA Collins
A,Hi Miss Collins.
A,How can I be of service?
C,I wanted to pay my bills using my rewards points but I can't log into your website.
C,What's happening?
A,Oh I'm so sorry for the inconvenience for the website.
A,May I know what error message you got?
C,Error message?
C,Where do I get that error message?
A,You mentioned you were trying to log in.
A,"When you logged into shapes rewards website, can you please tell me what happened after?"
C,"Oh I just entered my username and my password and then when I clicked log in, the computer the screen."
C,"What I'm seeing, it's the same."
C,It's loading and then it goes back to the login page so I can't get in and I need to use my rewards because I've saved them for so long now.
A,I understand Miss Collins.
A,Alright this what actually happened.
A,When you clicked log in and the screen or the page goes back to the exact same page after loading that means that the page is looping.
C,But what looping?
C,Is your website down?
A,Our website is actually up and running.
A,"However, your browser has an issue."
A,Looping is when the browser page goes back to the same page again and again even though you've already taken action.
A,"Just like in your case, you've clicked log in but it doesn't go to your profile on Shapes Rewards, right?"
A,It just keeps going back to the login page but don't worry you've got the right person on the line to help you.
A,We just need to do quick troubleshooting on your browser.
C,Okay.
A,Great!
A,Are you using Mac or PC?
C,Windows.
A,Ok Windows PC is good.
A,May I know what browser you're using?
C,I'm not really sure.;
A,Is it Google Chrome or Firefox?
C,Oh it's Chrome.
A,"Oh ok, that's great."
A,May I know the chrome version?
C,I am really sorry honey but I don't have any idea.
C,My granddaughter just gifted me this computer last Christmas and she's not here right now.
A,Oh that's ok Miss Collins.
A,I'll just give you instructions and we'll get through this.
C,Thank you honey.
C,So you said version?
A,"Yes, can you please close the Chrome browser and open it again after?"
C,"Yes, done."
A,That's good. 
A,"Now that you have the browser open, do you see 3 dots that are aligned vertically on the upper right part of your screen?"
C,Yes
A,Please click that and you will see a drop-down box.
A,Then look for the word help or about Google Chrome.
C,I do see help that about Google Chrome.
C,I clicked it.
C,Oh it's version 68 and a couple random numbers.
A,Wow thank you.
A,Looks like you have the most updated browser versions so far.
A,"So, the next thing, we will do is clear cache from your browser."
A,This will not affect your stored files or anything on your computer.
A,It's just that most of the time the information that you click out to the Internet gets saved in a cache memory or storage in your browser and this eventually results to latency or what you just experienced.
C,Oh this is all so new to me.
C,But you don't have to worry because once you do this once it's easier to do this again next time if it happens again.
A,So just click those three dots that you clicked earlier and look for more tools.
A,Did you see it?
C,Ok.
A,Then you will see clear browsing data.
C,Okay I see basic and advanced.
A,"Alright, we are on the right track."
A,We can just go to the basic part and make sure you check all the checkboxes for the browsing history cookies and cached images.
C,"Ok, done it."
A,"Then, if you see the time range you can choose all time. "
A,Then just click clear data.
C,"Okay, it's loading."
A,Yes yes that's normal.
A,"So once it's done loading, you will be on the same page."
A,"So, just press f5 on your keyboard to let it refresh and then you can start logging in again."
C,Ok I will try again.
A,"Ok, let me know what happens."
C,"Oh, I can login now."
C,I'm so happy.
A,I am so happy for you too Miss Collins and it has been my pleasure to assist you.
A,Did I address all your concerns today?
C,"Very much, thank you."
A,You're welcome.
A,Thanks for calling Shapes Rewards and enjoy your day.
A,Welcome to Grand Number One.
A,My name Selena.
A,May I have your name?
C,This is Rebecca Portman.
A,Hello Miss Portman.
A,How can I provide you an excellent service today?
C,Yes I just lost my debit card one hour ago.
C,I tried looking for it but I couldn't so I thought I'd let you know.
A,Oh I'm terribly sorry to hear that.
A,"But rest assured, I'll be here to make sure everything's well taken care of."
C,Thank you.
A,"To put your account, can I please have your account number or debit card number?"
C,I can't memorize my card number though but my account number is 123456785.
A,Oh yes.

A,"Yes, This just posted today."
A,Is this valid?
C,"Oh yes, that's mine."
C,I did that yesterday and it just posted recently here.
A,"Your debit card is safe, no unauthorized transaction so I'm closing it now tagging is as lost."
A,Would you like a replacement over the phone?
A,It's free of charge.
C,"Sure, how long will it take?"
A,"It will be delivered in 10 business days and while you're waiting for your new card, you may go to any branch to do an over to counter withdrawal."
A,Just bring two valid IDs.
C,That's fair enough.
A,Just a couple of reminders Miss Portman.
A,Your new debit card will have a new card number but the account number and PIN will remain the same.
A,Just call us right away once you receive it so that we can activate it for you and everything's good.
A,The replacement has been processed and have I address all your concerns?
C,"Yes yes, you did."

A,That's 99 dollars per night.
C,Okay.
A,There's also a deluxe room available that has the same amenities as premier except that it has its own swimming pool.
A,That costs $150 per night.
A,Which one you prefer?
C,Oh well we're just staying to sleep in so I'll take the premier.
C,Does it come with free breakfast?
A,Yes there's free breakfast.
A,Are you going to reserve today?
C,"Yes, please."
A,May I have the names of the guests?
C,Pauline Sue and my friends Andrea Smith and Alexis Washington
A,"Great, so you will check in on September 5 at 2 p.m. and check out on September 7 12 noon."
A,"So that's 2 nights for $198 and we have to add the taxes, so the total amount is 217 dollars and 56 cents."
C,"Thank you, so should I pay now or what?"
A,"That's right, you should."
A,"Yes, you should actually pay now."
A,"Alright, so just to recap I have already reserved the premier room for you for two nights on September 5 to 7 with total cost two hundred and seventeen dollars and 56 cents."
A,This is actually considered booked.
A,"If you decide to cancel within 15 days before your check-in date, there will be no cancellation fee and the money will be refunded to you in 10 business days. "

A,"Hi, thank you for calling X Y Z."
A,My name is Ashley. 
A,How may i help?
C,You just cut off my internet connection and this is not the first time this happened!
C,Why are you cheating on me? You're getting my money and you're cutting me off!
A,Sorry for the inconvenience ma'am.
A,I understand that is really frustrating.
A,May I have your account number please?
C,"Sorry, you are always sorry, but you're not doing anything!"
C,Never!
C,"You have to fix this now, fix this now!"
A,"Yes, yes, ma'am. I will do my best."
A,May I have your account number so that I can check your account?
C,"Five three four zero zero three, six five four eight"
A,"I'm sorry, you were a bit too fast. ."
A,Can you please?
C,Oh my god.

C,I said five three four zero zero three six five four eight.
A,"I'm sorry, is that five three four zero zero three six five"
C,"Four eight, got it?"
A,"Okay, got it."
A,Thank you.
A,"For verification purposes, can I get your name and birth date, please?;"
C,"Karen America, September 15 1985."
C,The account is under my name.
C,Hello?
A,"Hello, I'm still here ma'am."
A,Sorry. I'm still checking some information.
C,Why is it taking you so long?
C,Don't you guys already know this stuff?
C,You keep fooling people.
C,You must know what to do already.
A,"Okay, according to our systems data you did pay your last bill last October 20, which was two days ago in one of our affiliated payment centers."
A,"Unfortunately when you pay through that affiliated center, it takes about 2 to 3 business days more to complete the payment processing."
A,So that means that the system considered the payment as still pending and not completed yet.
A,"So the connection has been cut off, but."
C,Are you kidding me?
C,Why have affiliated payment centers when you can't even process the payment on time?
C,So it's my fault?
C,You guys told me I could pay at affiliated centers and that's what I did and now I'm at fault.
C,"Now, I can't continue with my online job because of you or actually because of me?"
C,That's ridiculous!
A,"I am really sorry, Miss America."
A,I understand your situation is very tough right now.
C,"Really, huh?"
A,"But, what I can do is to open a ticket or submit a report so that the other department assigned can manually complete your payment and reconnect your internet."
A,I just need the payment ID number ma'am and which center did you make the payment?
C,Why do you have to ask for that? 
C,You just said so yourself you've seen my payment as pending?
A,"Yeah, and just want to verify it."
C,"At the Strawberry Mall, my payment ID. Hold on a second. One one one two eight five six nine seven four."
A,"Thanks so much for your patience, Miss America."
A,I'm going to submit the report
C,"Please just stay on the line for a minute, Ma'am."
A,"I'm done with the report, please expect to have your connection reinstated within 24 hours."
A,We will send you a text message as well to your phone number and file.
C,Within 24 hours?
C,Can you make it faster than that?
A,"As much as I'd love to that has been a turnaround time for reconnection since then, so to give enough time for the team to manually complete the payment."
C,"Okay fine, as if I have a choice."
A,"Again, I'm really sorry."
A,Is there anything else?
C,"Nothing, just make sure you reconnect my line as soon as possible."
A,"Bye, yes, ma'am. "

A,Sounds great so I was saying may I know the name on the account?
C,My name?
A,"Yes, if the account is under your name."
C,"Yes, it's Anjoe Jones."
A,Thank You Mr. Jones.
C,What did you say?
A,Oh I just said thank you Mr. Jones.
A,"So, you mentioned you don't have internet today. "
A,"Shows here that you don't have a DSL signal, that's why.you cannot connect"
A,We can actually fix this over the phone and I'd be glad to walk you through.
A,Would that be fine?
C,I already did everything before I called.
A,That's great.
A,"Let me ask, can you please check your modem now and tell me which lights are on?"
C,Seriously!
C,"Okay, I have to go back to my brother's room."
A,Please check.
C,"Okay., the rest of the of the lights are green but the DSL was red."
A,"Alright, clearly, there is something wrong with your signal which is highly likely connected to your cell phone service."
A,Can you please check again your telephone cord is connected to your modem?
C,"Wow, so I have to go back again?"
A,"Don't worry, that's the last thing we have to check if the cord is indeed not connected tightly plug it back into your modem and everything should be good so that we do not have to call a technician to check out what's wrong with the modem."
C,"Okay fine, just don't hang up!"
A,Of course! I won't.
C,I just found out the cord was disconnected.
C,Probably my brother.
C,I can see the DSL light is green.
A,Oh that's good to know.
A,Can you try accessing some website?
C,Okay I can access my online games now and Facebook too.
C,"Yeah, I think you solved it."
A,My pleasure to assist you.
A,Have I addressed your concerns?
C,You sure did.
C,I'll tell my brother.
C,Thank you.
A,Thanks for calling Quick Internet.
A,Once again this is Anna.
A,Have a wonderful day.
A,Thank you for calling Sprites.
A,My name is Rhea.
A,How can I help you today?
C,"Hi, my name is Francis and I have a question about my bill."
A,Oh hi Francis.
A,I'll be glad to answer any questions that you have about your bill.
A,May I have the account number or the phone number of the account?
C,Ok the account number is 1 2 3 4 5.
A,Great! Thank you. 
A,"So, may I know what your question is?"
C,"Oh it's like this, last month, my bill was $25 but for this month it shows that I need to pay $35."
C,What's going on?
A,Oh I see.
A,"I understand sometimes looking at your bill can be quite confusing. So, let me check your account and let's go through this together ok?"
A,By the way do you have a copy of your bill right now?
C,Um yes.
A,That's great.
A,Let's go over your bill together and see the difference.
A,"Upon checking your account., yes, you're right."
A,The bill last month was $25 however this billing period there is an additional charge of 10 dollars for a data usage that totals to 3 gigs.
C,Ok. I really thought that my plan included data.
A,"Well, no, it does not."
A,But I will be happy to add a data to your plan.
A,For only five dollars more you get 10 gigs of data and it's more value for your money considering the current situation.
A,How does that sound to you?
C,Um okay that sounds good.
A,"That's good, so I'll add the data plan to your account right away and since you are a valued customer, I will also take care of the $10 charge for you."
C,I mean that's great.
A,So let me just process the reversal real quick okay and it's done so let me just recap everything we have talked about the $10 charge.
A,I have added a data plan of 10 gigs to your account so that's going to be $5 more in addition to the $25 that you are already paying every month and the $10 charge for this billing period was already reversed.
C,"It's strictly appreciated, thank you."
A,You're welcome and just to let you know you can also check your data usage by texting data to 777.
A,"So, have I addressed all your concerns today?"
C,Yes you have.
A,Well it's been my pleasure to assist you Francis.
A,"Once again, my name is Rhea."
A,Thank you for calling Sprite and hope you have a great day
C,"Do the same, bye bye."
A,Thank you for calling Life Member Services.
A,This is Raya.
A,How can I help you today?
C,I have a question about something I received in a mail.
A,"Sure, I'll be glad to assist you with that mail."
A,Can you please tell me more about the mail you received?
C,"Well you see it's like this: a couple weeks ago, I was involved in an accident and I was rushed to hospital but I feel better now anyways."
C,I was under the impression that my insurance or you guys will cover the whole bill but this paperwork says something else.
A,I am sincerely glad to know that you're all good now.
A,I will be happy to check your account so that I can help you better.
A,May I have your complete name and member ID?
C,"Peter Porter, ID Number is 6757897."
A,Thank you Peter.
A,How about your date of birth and address?
C,It's May 12 85. 
C,"321, First Street, LA."
A,Thank you.
A,"Let me check your account real quick, ok?"
C,Ok.
A,"I've been checking here Peter, it shows that a claim for $1000 was paid last week that was August 12 and that it says that it actually covers your entire bill."
A,"By the way that letter that you received, on the topmost right part, does it say this is not a bill?"
C,Oh well!
C,"Now that you mention it, it does say this is not a bill."
A,"Ok, that's good to know because what you have there is an EOB or an explanation of benefits."
A,It should show the breakdown of the charges and the amount that we your insurance paid for.
A,"So you see every time a claim is processed, you will get that information for transparency see and I truly apologize for the confusion that this letter has cost you."
C,Ah see.
C,That's good because you know I still have some medicine to buy and the last thing that I want right now is to pay another bill.
A,I know I understand I'm glad to clear things up for you and again no need to worry about the hospital bill we took care of it for you.
A,"Just take care of yourself, okay?"
C,"Well, okay."
C,Thank you so much.
A,Have I addressed your concerns today?
C,Yes. you have. Oh I'm just happy everything is paid for.
A,"Yes, it is."

A,I appreciate that you bring this to out attention sir And sorry for the inconvenience sir.
A,"I understand that it is very frustrating and to work out on your problem about the abrupt disconnection, is that right sir?"

A,"According to our system's data, that you did pay your last bill, last February 5 which was 2 days ago in one of our affiliated payment centers."
A,"Unfortunately sir, when you pay through that affiliated center, it takes about three to five business days more to complete the payment processing so that means that the system conceded the payment as still pending and not completed yet."
A,"So, the connection has been cut off. But."
C,Are you kidding me?
C,I need it as soon as possible.
A,I understand that your situation is very tough right now.
A,"Since you did pay for your connection, what I can do is to open a ticket or submit a report so that the other department can immediately complete your payment and reconnect your internet as soon as possible. "
A,"And to make it possible sir, I just need your payment ID."
C,Okay so my payment ID is 19216811.
C,Did you get it?
A,"Yes sir, thank you."
A,I am now doing the report and will submit it as soon as I finish this.
A,Please stay online for a minute Mr. Sobremonte.

A,We will send you a text message informing that you have already paid and connected to the internet service to your phone number.
C,Thank God for that!
C,I am furious because I really need internet connection.
A,"Again sir, I'm terribly sorry."

A,Thank you.
A,Let me proceed to your account.
A,"Max, when you place your first order, Rex Global contacts your issuing bank to confirm the validity of the payment method."
A,It is not an actual charge but a one dollar authorisation hold.
C,"Seriously, for how long will it take?"
A,"Well, it isn't that long, most often, it takes 1 to 2 business days."

C,I mean now I understand.
C,"I appreciate that, thanks."
A,You're most welcome.
A,I can also send a confirmation regarding this call for your reference.

A,This is Carla.
A,Can I have your name please?
C,"Hi Carla, I'm Athena."
A,Hello Athena.
A,How are you today and how can I assist?
C,I am really frustrated right now.
C,I'm calling because I ordered an item last Monday from your store.
C,I expedited it to two-day shipping just to make sure that i'll be receiving the item on or before Thursday.
C,"It's a birthday present, tomorrow."
C,"Listen y'all, I paid for expedited shipping but i'm not receiving the item for three days already."
C,I need someone who can help explain this to me!
A,I understand your.
C,You know what's funny?
C,It was tracked as delivered yesterday.
C,I looked everywhere in the house.
C,It's nowhere to be found.
C,I don't know what y'all are doing.
C,What I'm certain is-this is a scam.
C,"If you can't handle this, let me just talk with the supervisor."
A,I am really sorry to hear if you haven't received your item for a special event.
A,Also if it was tracked as delivered although not yet received.
A,I do understand your frustration right now for this inconvenience but no worries.
A,Rest assured that this company isn't a scam and I can definitely help you.
C,Okay let's see.
A,"Alright, For security purposes can I have your complete name please?"
C,It's Athena Salmnher.
A,Thank you.
A,Can I also have the email address associated with your account?
C,It's athena561@yahoo.com.
A,Okay thank you.
A,How about the last four digits of the order number?
C,Okay i think it's 2341.
A,"Got it, so those were man sneaker shoes and an iPhone."
A,"One second, let me check the details for a while."
A,"Based on the information, here it was delivered and received."
A,To verify could you tell me the shipping address you wanted to ship the parcel?
C,Oh you're wasting my time!
C,"It's in Wilmington, North Carolina."
A,"Hmm, based on the record here, it seems that the parcel was delivered to the wrong address."
C,Wow! This is terrible.
C,I have to request for a refund away to be processed.
C,The worst part is they have to reorder and expedite it without assurance of having the item tomorrow.
C,Horrible!
A,"Oh, I understand where you're coming from Athena."
A,"To compensate, I can process a replacement and expedite in the same day shipping."
A,You don't have to pay for the shipment.
A,You just have to wait.
A,I'll get back to you and notify you once the package shipped out.
A,I'll be tracking the package and I will check with the carrier just to make sure that it will be delivered in the correct address and within a day.
A,Would that work for you?;
C,Oh that's very kind of you.
C,I really appreciate it.
A,No problem.
A,I've successfully processed a replacement and sent you the confirmation regarding this call as your reference.
A,Expect to receive the products within a day.
C,Oh my gosh.
C,"Wow, you're amazing!"
C,I really apologise for what I said earlier.
A,"It's okay, I understand I would feel the same way if I am in your situation."
A,Thank you for your patience by the way.
A,Anything else that I can help?
C,No No No you're doing great.
C,Everything is fine right now.
A,That's good to hear.
A,I'm glad to help you.
A,"For other concerns, feel free to visit our help pages."
A,Thank you for calling JP  International.
A,Have a nice day.
C,You as well.
C,Thank you so much.
C,Goodbye.
A,Goodbye.
A,Hi.
A,Thank you for calling home supplies.
A,This is Candice.
A,How may I help you?
C,Order number 123456.
C,Full name Amber Hill.
A,Thank You.
A,Give me one moment please so I can pull up your account.
A,"Okay, I got your order here and it was for a convection oven for 129."
A,Is this correct?
C,"Yes, correct."
C,Except that you guys sent me a cutting board
A,Oh I am so sorry.
A,That was.
C,No no no no no no. 
C,Let me finish.
C,"Don't give me your story for this inconvenience bullshit, because this is not an inconvenience Candice."
C,This is a disaster.
C,I am upset.
C,I waited one long week.
C,One long week and you guys sent me a cutting board.
C,"I mean, how would you even explain that Candice?"
C,How could you even explain that someone from your shipping department could mistake a piece of cutting board for an oven?
C,That's what i'd like to know because I can see how it's my son's birthday this Thursday and I need that oven to bake his cake.
C,It is now Monday and I have no oven but hey I guess that's okay right because I have a fucking cutting board.
A,"Amber, I truly understand how frustrating this is for you."
A,"I truly do, I do."
A,I know that our shipping department tries to their best to keep the orders as accurate as possible but on very rare occasions this kind of mistake happens from time to time.
A,And I am so sorry that this happened to you.
A,"Of course, this is not an excuse and a mistake is a mistake."
A,"And right now, what I can do is to help you resolve this issue."
C,"Well, they shouldn't have done that to me."
C,It's for my son's birthday and a cutting board for an oven?
C,"I mean, I mean I can understand if you sent me an oven with the wrong model number but a cutting board?"
C,"Seriously, I don't know about you but this smells like a practical joke to me."
A,I assure you amber what happened was an honest mistake.
A,We would never do that to our customers on purpose.
A,"Of course, you really should have received precisely what you ordered and we failed on that and for that I am truly sorry."
A,The best thing that i can do for you now is to make sure that this gets resolved as soon as possible.
C,"Well. I don't really have a choice, do I?"
C,So get on with it.
A,"Okay so if i heard you right, your son's birthday is this coming Thursday right?"
C,"Yes, that's right."
A,Alright here's what I'm gonna do.
A,"Because you received the wrong item, I will request to have the correct item sent out to you within 24 business hours."
A,"So if we send it to you today, you should receive the oven before your son's birthday on Thursday."
A,All I need from you to make that happen is the photo of the wrong item you received along with a photo of the barcode.
A,Is it possible that you could send to me while we're on the line so I could already process the reshipment for you?
C,I can send you the photo but um let me ask you this.
C,What guarantee do I have that your company is not gonna mess up again?
C,Because my purpose really for calling you guys is to just get a refund.
C,I really just want to order from amazon because they have a one-day shipping.
C,"Uh no offence Candice, but because of what you sent to me, I'm just not confident enough with your company anymore."
A,Good point Amber and I understand your doubt.
A,"But, when we encounter this kind of issue where a customer receives a damaged item or as in your case a wrong item, we always make sure to handle the matter with extra care so there will be no second mistake."
A,No chance for a second mistake happening.
A,"So, that is why aside from the 24 hour shipping, we will also do a thorough recheck of the reshipment."
A,"So, I can definitely assure you that it's going to be the correct item this time."
C,Well okay.
C,I guess I'm just gonna have to give you another shot.
C,So where do I send the photos to?
A,You can send it to support@homesupplies.com.
C,"Okay hold on, let me go get my phone because I already took a photo of the cutting board yesterday so I should have it on my phone right here."
C,Hold on.
C,"Okay, uh so that's support@homesupplies.com."
C,Okay sent.
C,Can you see it?
A,"Okay, let me check."
A,"Okay yes, I got it."
A,"Um, by the way Amber, do you also have the photo of the barcode of the cutting board?"
C,Is that really necessary?
C,I'm not lying.
A,"Yes Amber, I would need it to have your reshipment approved as soon as possible."
A,"After that, we will ship the oven to you immediately and you should receive it within 24 hours."
C,Okay let me go upstairs and take a photo.
C,Can you hold?
A,"Sure, take your time."
C,"Hello, are you there?"
C,"Yes Amber, I'm here."
C,I've sent it
C,Did you get it? 
A,Yes i got it.
A,"Um so now, I will forward the photos to the reshipment team and you should receive the oven tomorrow."
A,"About the cutting board you received, you don't have to return it."
A,Um just feel free to keep it keep it or give it away.
C,"Oh good, I totally forgot to ask you about that."
C,So thank you Candice.
C,I really don't want to drive to the post just to return that.
C,"So alright, um I guess it's all good then."
C,All settled.
A,"Yeah, yes all you have to do now is to wait for the replacement to arrive tomorrow."
A,And we will take care of everything and again we are so sorry for this mistake.
C,"Well. As long as the oven arrives tomorrow, I am happy."
C,Thank you Candice.
C,You've been very patient.
A,You're most welcome Amber.
A,Is there anything else that I can help you with today?
C,No that's all.
C,You have a great day Candice.
A,"Bye, have a great day Amber."
A,Thank you for calling home supplies.
C,Bye.
A,Hi.
A,Thank you for calling Power Up company.
A,This is Candice.
A,How may I help you?
C,Hi Candice.
C,So I'm calling because you guys overcharged me.
C,"Um my subscription to you guys is supposed to be a flat rate 30 dollar per month but for some reason, I am seeing 33 on my paper bill for the month of July so I don't know what's going on."
C,I would really appreciate an explanation on this.
A,"Sure, I'll be happy to pull up your account now and check the billing details for you."
A,Can I have your account number together with your first and last name?
C,"Sure, it's 12345 and my full name is John Williams."
A,Thank you John.
A,Just give me a few seconds to pull up your account.
A,"It was for the month of July this year, right?"
C,July 2020.
C,That's right.
A,Okay let me see that.
A,"Okay, I have your account pulled up now and I'm only seeing a 30 charge for the month of July this year."
A,Could you recheck your bill and review the amount?
C,"No, that can't be right."
C,I am literally holding my bill right now and it says July.
C,And it says 33 dollars in big bold letters.
C,"So, maybe the charge was moved to June or August."
C,I don't know.
C,All I know is that you're overcharging me and it's written on my paper bill.
A,Yes John.
A,"I also checked your other month's charges this year from January to July 2020 and all of these months, you were only charged 30."
A,Let me just check further though your last year.
A,"Oh, although I am seeing a 33 dollar charge here but this was way back last year on July 2019."
A,Would you mind checking the year of the billing paper you're holding right now?
C,"Oh, Oh my god Candice."
C,I'm so so sorry to have wasted your time.
C,I really thought this was a recent bill.
A,"No, don't worry about it John."
A,You're fine.
C,This bill was literally on my table this morning.
C,I must have dropped it when I was throwing garbage this morning.
C,So embarrassing.
C,My bad.
A,"Oh no problem, It happens."
A,I mean it happens to all of us you know.
C,I know right.
C,"Anyway Candice, I won't waste any more of your time and thank you so much for your patience."
A,You're welcome John.
A,Is there anything else that I can help you with today?
C,Maybe no.
C,I won't waste any more of your time.
C,That's all Candice.
C,Have a good one.
A,Have a good one John.
A,Thank you for calling Power Up.
A,Bye.
C,Bye Candice.
A,Thank you for calling Coats and Gowns.
A,My name is Sam.
A,How can I help you?
C,Oh yes.
C,"Um, I bought a coat from from you guys but I need to return it because it was the wrong size and my size is not available."
C,I haven't received any email from you and I wonder if my payment is gonna get refunded.
C,It seems like it does not reflect on my account yet.
A,I do apologize for the inconvenience but let me go ahead and check if there are some notes and order details.
A,May I ask for the original online order number?
C,"Okay, let me see."
C,"Alright, Please wait for a moment."
C,"Okay, I believe it's 01714257893."
A,Thank you.
A,"Just to verify, that's 01714257893."
C,"Yes, that's right."
A,I do apologize but the one that you provided is actually not accepting towards our database.
A,Do you actually have a number that starts with triple 0 7 or 7?
A,"Or, can I ask for your first and last name so I can manually check it in our database?"
C,Yeah. I'm not sure about a triple 0 something.
C,"In a way, it's Adam Wilson."
A,"Alright, thank you so much Wilson."
A,"This is spelled as W for whiskey, I for India, L for Lima, S for Sierra, O for Oscar, and N for November."
A,Is that correct Adam? 
C,"Alright, thank you for that information."
A,"Okay, let me just quickly look into a portal and check any notes in your order."
A,Do you still have the return tracking from the courier company when you returned the item?
C,Not sure.
C,Is it the 74391?
A,That's actually the return authorization from Coats and Gowns.
A,"When you returned the item to the courier company for shipping, this should have provided you with the return tracking."
A,Do you still have that?
A,It's actually printed in the upper right part of the receipt.
C,"Okay, I probably have to take it up okay."
C,I imagine I have it somewhere but it might take some time to look for that.
A,"Oh, I see."
A,"Anyway, I tried to search for your name and nothing is coming up."
A,Can I ask for the order under your name originally?
C,Yeah yes under my name.
C,So it's not under Andy or something.
A,It's Adam.
C,Yeah exactly.
A,Thank you.
A,Now what's the phone number that you put into order before?
C,Okay probably it's 4113450377.
