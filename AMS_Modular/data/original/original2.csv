A,Thanks sir.  I have your account pulled up.
A,I can see there is no upstream signal coming from your box.
C,What does that mean?
A,"It means that while you can watch channels that don't require two way communication, you can't watch content that requires input and output."
C,"Oh, so anything where I request a stream?"
A,Exactly sir.  Can you turn off the cable box for me?
C,"Yes, it is done."
A,"Alright sir, just a moment until I see the device go offline"
