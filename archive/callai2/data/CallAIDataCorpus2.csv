A,Greetings,Positive,Thank you for calling Triple-A bank.
A,Greetings,Positive,My name is Arianna.
A,Greetings,Positive,May I have your name?
C,,,James breed; 
A,Greetings,Positive,Oh hello Mr. Breed.
A,Greetings,,How can I make you smile today?
C,,,Why do I have fees on my bank account? 
C,,,I want those removed. 
C,,,Very ridiculous.
C,,,I can't even afford them.
A,Engagement,Positive,Oh. I understand that fees are really costly. 
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,Let me check your account to see what really happened.
C,,,Ok and remove the fees
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,I'll see what I can do Mr. Breed. 
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,As I have checked you were charged some fees because you were not able to pay on time so that means we really cannot do anything about it anymore.
C,,,What do you mean you can't do anything? 
C,,,You are supposed to help me.
C,,,Can you at least try to remove the fees?
A,Problem Resolution,Negative,"No, no sir. "
A,Problem Resolution,Negative,I can't do that because you did not make a payment.
C,,,"If you just look at my account I made a payment but it was just a few hours late."
C,,,Can you at least consider? 
C,,,I had to look for funds just to make a payment but I did my best to pay on my due date.
C,,,I was just late for the cutoff.
C,,,Can you please just remove at least one fee?
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"As much as I'd love to help you Mr. Breed, my hands are tied right now."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,There's nothing I can do.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,I already told you the reason and I'm afraid you'll have to pay the fees you'll have to pay the fees for now.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,I want to let you know that you can actually avoid these fees by paying before 4 p.m. of your due date.
A,,,I already know that. 
C,,,You already explained that.
C,,,You keep telling me the same thing but you're not doing anything.
C,,,I will make sure to call back and speak to your supervisor. 
C,,,You are not helping me at all even though I've been a customer for five years!
C,,,Terrible service!
A,Engagement,Positive,I'm really really really sorry sir.
C,,,No. You are not sorry.
A,Greetings,Positive,Thank you for calling Triple-A bank.
A,Greetings,Positive,My name is Maria.
A,Greetings,Positive,May I have your name?
C,,,James breed; 
A,Greetings,Positive,Oh hello Mr. Breed.
A,Greetings,Positive,How can I make you smile today?
C,,,Why do I have fees on my bank account?
C,,,I want those removed.
C,,, Very ridiculous.
C,,,I can't even afford them.
A,Engagement,Positive,Oh. I understand that fees are really costly.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,Let me check your account to see what really happened.
C,,,Ok.
C,,,And remove the fees.
A,,,I'll see what I can do Mr. Breed.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,"As I have checked, the account was charged some fees because there was no payment made before the cut off time of 4 p.m."
C,,,I made a payment.
C,,,I did my best to look for funds so I could pay on my due date.
C,,,It's just that it was done after 4 p.m.
A,Engagement,Positive,I truly understand what you're going through Mr. Breed.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"However, the fees charged were valid and therefore, the fees can no longer be refunded or removed."
C,,,Like I said I really did my best. Can you please remove even just one fee?
C,,,I really can't afford it.
C,,,Maybe you can make a consideration?
C,,,Please. Besides I made a payment on the due date itself.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"I understand your concern sir and as much as I want to remove the fees, they really can no longer be removed."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"However, since you requested, okay, I will send a request to the management and it's up to them to decide whatever course of action they will do after reviewing your account but this doesn't guarantee that the fees will be refunded."
C,,,Okay I understand that it's worth trying though.
C,,,Thank you for doing that.
A,Engagement,Positive,You're welcome Mr. Breed.
A,Closure,Positive,I have already submitted a request and you will receive an email or text message after three days for the decision.
C,,,Thanks for trying.
A,Greetings,Positive,Thank you for calling Shapes Reward.
A,Greetings,Positive,My name is Mathilda.
A,Greetings,Positive,Can I have your name please?
C,,,This is ELISA Collins
A,Greetings,Positive,Hi Miss Collins.
A,Greetings,Positive,How can I be of service?
C,,,I wanted to pay my bills using my rewards points but I can't log into your website.
C,,,What's happening?
A,Engagement,Positive,Oh I'm so sorry for the inconvenience for the website.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,May I know what error message you got?
C,,,Error message?
C,,,Where do I get that error message?
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,You mentioned you were trying to log in.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,"When you logged into shapes rewards website, can you please tell me what happened after?"
C,,,"Oh I just entered my username and my password and then when I clicked log in, the computer the screen."
C,,,"What I'm seeing, it's the same."
C,,,It's loading and then it goes back to the login page so I can't get in and I need to use my rewards because I've saved them for so long now.
A,Engagement,Positive,I understand Miss Collins.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,Alright this what actually happened.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,When you clicked log in and the screen or the page goes back to the exact same page after loading that means that the page is looping.
C,,,But what looping?
C,,,Is your website down?
A,NA,,Our website is actually up and running.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,"However, your browser has an issue."
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,Looping is when the browser page goes back to the same page again and again even though you've already taken action.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,"Just like in your case, you've clicked log in but it doesn't go to your profile on Shapes Rewards, right?"
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,It just keeps going back to the login page but don't worry you've got the right person on the line to help you.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,We just need to do quick troubleshooting on your browser.
C,,,Okay.
A,NA,,Great!
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,Are you using Mac or PC?
C,,,Windows.
A,NA,,Ok Windows PC is good.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,May I know what browser you're using?
C,,,I'm not really sure.;
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,Is it Google Chrome or Firefox?
C,,,Oh it's Chrome.
A,NA,,"Oh ok, that's great."
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,May I know the chrome version?
C,,,I am really sorry honey but I don't have any idea.
C,,,My granddaughter just gifted me this computer last Christmas and she's not here right now.
A,NA,,Oh that's ok Miss Collins.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,I'll just give you instructions and we'll get through this.
C,,,Thank you honey.
C,,,So you said version?
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"Yes, can you please close the Chrome browser and open it again after?"
C,,,"Yes, done."
A,NA,,That's good. 
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"Now that you have the browser open, do you see 3 dots that are aligned vertically on the upper right part of your screen?"
C,,,Yes
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,Please click that and you will see a drop-down box.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,Then look for the word help or about Google Chrome.
C,,,I do see help that about Google Chrome.
C,,,I clicked it.
C,,,Oh it's version 68 and a couple random numbers.
A,Engagement,Positive,Wow thank you.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,Looks like you have the most updated browser versions so far.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"So, the next thing, we will do is clear cache from your browser."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,This will not affect your stored files or anything on your computer.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,It's just that most of the time the information that you click out to the Internet gets saved in a cache memory or storage in your browser and this eventually results to latency or what you just experienced.
C,,,Oh this is all so new to me.
C,,,But you don't have to worry because once you do this once it's easier to do this again next time if it happens again.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,So just click those three dots that you clicked earlier and look for more tools.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,Did you see it?
C,,,Ok.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,Then you will see clear browsing data.
C,,,Okay I see basic and advanced.
A,Engagement,Positive,"Alright, we are on the right track."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,We can just go to the basic part and make sure you check all the checkboxes for the browsing history cookies and cached images.
C,,,"Ok, done it."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"Then, if you see the time range you can choose all time. "
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,Then just click clear data.
C,,,"Okay, it's loading."
A,NA,,Yes yes that's normal.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"So once it's done loading, you will be on the same page."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"So, just press f5 on your keyboard to let it refresh and then you can start logging in again."
C,,,Ok I will try again.
A,Engagement,,"Ok, let me know what happens."
C,,,"Oh, I can login now."
C,,,I'm so happy.
A,Closure,Positive,I am so happy for you too Miss Collins and it has been my pleasure to assist you.
A,Closure,Positive,Did I address all your concerns today?

A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"So that's 2 nights for $198 and we have to add the taxes, so the total amount is 217 dollars and 56 cents."
C,,,"Thank you, so should I pay now or what?"
A,,,"That's right, you should."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"Yes, you should actually pay now."

A,,,Sorry for the inconvenience ma'am.
A,Engagement,Positive,I understand that is really frustrating.
A,Account Verification,Positive,May I have your account number please?
C,,,"Sorry, you are always sorry, but you're not doing anything!"
C,,,Never!
C,,,"You have to fix this now, fix this now!"
A,Engagement,Positive,"Yes, yes, ma'am. I will do my best."
A,Account Verification,Positive,May I have your account number so that I can check your account?

A,NA,,"Hello, I'm still here ma'am."
A,Engagement,Positive,Sorry. I'm still checking some information.
C,,,Why is it taking you so long?
C,,,Don't you guys already know this stuff?
C,,,You keep fooling people.
C,,,You must know what to do already.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,"Okay, according to our systems data you did pay your last bill last October 20, which was two days ago in one of our affiliated payment centers."
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,"Unfortunately when you pay through that affiliated center, it takes about 2 to 3 business days more to complete the payment processing."
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,So that means that the system considered the payment as still pending and not completed yet.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,"So the connection has been cut off, but."
C,,,Are you kidding me?
C,,,Why have affiliated payment centers when you can't even process the payment on time?
C,,,So it's my fault?
C,,,You guys told me I could pay at affiliated centers and that's what I did and now I'm at fault.
C,,,"Now, I can't continue with my online job because of you or actually because of me?"
C,,,That's ridiculous!
A,Engagement,Positive,"I am really sorry, Miss America."
A,Engagement,Positive,I understand your situation is very tough right now.
C,,,"Really, huh?"
A,Account Verification,Positive,"But, what I can do is to open a ticket or submit a report so that the other department assigned can manually complete your payment and reconnect your internet."
A,Account Verification,Positive,I just need the payment ID number ma'am and which center did you make the payment?
C,,,Why do you have to ask for that? 
C,,,You just said so yourself you've seen my payment as pending?
A,NA,,"Yeah, and just want to verify it."
C,,,"At the Strawberry Mall, my payment ID. Hold on a second. One one one two eight five six nine seven four."
A,Engagement,Positive,"Thanks so much for your patience, Miss America."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,I'm going to submit the report
C,,,"Please just stay on the line for a minute, Ma'am."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"I'm done with the report, please expect to have your connection reinstated within 24 hours."
A,Problem Resolution,,We will send you a text message as well to your phone number and file.
C,,,Within 24 hours?
C,,,Can you make it faster than that?
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"As much as I'd love to that has been a turnaround time for reconnection since then, so to give enough time for the team to manually complete the payment."
C,,,"Okay fine, as if I have a choice."
A,Engagement,Positive,"Again, I'm really sorry."
A,Closure,Positive,Is there anything else?
C,,,"Nothing, just make sure you reconnect my line as soon as possible."
A,Closure,Positive,"Bye, yes, ma'am. "

C,,,"Wow, so I have to go back again?"
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"Don't worry, that's the last thing we have to check if the cord is indeed not connected tightly plug it back into your modem and everything should be good so that we do not have to call a technician to check out what's wrong with the modem."
C,,,"Okay fine, just don't hang up!"
A,NA,,Of course! I won't.

A,Problem Investigation,Positive,By the way do you have a copy of your bill right now?
C,,,Um yes.
A,NA,,That's great.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,Let's go over your bill together and see the difference.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,"Upon checking your account., yes, you're right."
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,The bill last month was $25 however this billing period there is an additional charge of 10 dollars for a data usage that totals to 3 gigs.
C,,,Ok. I really thought that my plan included data.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"Well, no, it does not."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,But I will be happy to add a data to your plan.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,For only five dollars more you get 10 gigs of data and it's more value for your money considering the current situation.
A,Engagement,Positive,How does that sound to you?
C,,,Um okay that sounds good.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"That's good, so I'll add the data plan to your account right away and since you are a valued customer, I will also take care of the $10 charge for you."
C,,,I mean that's great.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,So let me just process the reversal real quick okay and it's done so let me just recap everything we have talked about the $10 charge.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,I have added a data plan of 10 gigs to your account so that's going to be $5 more in addition to the $25 that you are already paying every month and the $10 charge for this billing period was already reversed.
C,,,"It's strictly appreciated, thank you."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,You're welcome and just to let you know you can also check your data usage by texting data to 777.
A,Closure,Positive,"So, have I addressed all your concerns today?"

C,,,Order number 123456.
C,,,Full name Amber Hill.
A,Engagement,Positive,Thank You.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,Give me one moment please so I can pull up your account.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,"Okay, I got your order here and it was for a convection oven for 129."
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,Is this correct?
C,,,"Yes, correct."
C,,,Except that you guys sent me a cutting board
A,Engagement,Positive,Oh I am so sorry.
A,NA,,That was.
C,,,No no no no no no. 
C,,,Let me finish.
C,,,"Don't give me your story for this inconvenience bullshit, because this is not an inconvenience Candice."
C,,,This is a disaster.
C,,,I am upset.
C,,,I waited one long week.
C,,,One long week and you guys sent me a cutting board.
C,,,"I mean, how would you even explain that Candice?"
C,,,How could you even explain that someone from your shipping department could mistake a piece of cutting board for an oven?
C,,,That's what i'd like to know because I can see how it's my son's birthday this Thursday and I need that oven to bake his cake.
C,,,It is now Monday and I have no oven but hey I guess that's okay right because I have a fucking cutting board.
A,Engagement,Positive,"Amber, I truly understand how frustrating this is for you."
A,Engagement,Positive,"I truly do, I do."
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,I know that our shipping department tries to their best to keep the orders as accurate as possible but on very rare occasions this kind of mistake happens from time to time.
A,Engagement,Positive,And I am so sorry that this happened to you.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,"Of course, this is not an excuse and a mistake is a mistake."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"And right now, what I can do is to help you resolve this issue."
C,,,"Well, they shouldn't have done that to me."
C,,,It's for my son's birthday and a cutting board for an oven?
C,,,"I mean, I mean I can understand if you sent me an oven with the wrong model number but a cutting board?"
C,,,"Seriously, I don't know about you but this smells like a practical joke to me."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,I assure you amber what happened was an honest mistake.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,We would never do that to our customers on purpose.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"Of course, you really should have received precisely what you ordered and we failed on that and for that I am truly sorry."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,The best thing that i can do for you now is to make sure that this gets resolved as soon as possible.
C,,,"Well. I don't really have a choice, do I?"
C,,,So get on with it.
A,NA,,"Okay so if i heard you right, your son's birthday is this coming Thursday right?"
C,,,"Yes, that's right."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,Alright here's what I'm gonna do.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"Because you received the wrong item, I will request to have the correct item sent out to you within 24 business hours."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"So if we send it to you today, you should receive the oven before your son's birthday on Thursday."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,All I need from you to make that happen is the photo of the wrong item you received along with a photo of the barcode.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,Is it possible that you could send to me while we're on the line so I could already process the reshipment for you?
C,,,I can send you the photo but um let me ask you this.
C,,,What guarantee do I have that your company is not gonna mess up again?
C,,,Because my purpose really for calling you guys is to just get a refund.
C,,,I really just want to order from amazon because they have a one-day shipping.
C,,,"Uh no offence Candice, but because of what you sent to me, I'm just not confident enough with your company anymore."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,Good point Amber and I understand your doubt.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"But, when we encounter this kind of issue where a customer receives a damaged item or as in your case a wrong item, we always make sure to handle the matter with extra care so there will be no second mistake."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,No chance for a second mistake happening.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"So, that is why aside from the 24 hour shipping, we will also do a thorough recheck of the reshipment."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"So, I can definitely assure you that it's going to be the correct item this time."
C,,,Well okay.
C,,,I guess I'm just gonna have to give you another shot.
C,,,So where do I send the photos to?
A,NA,,You can send it to support@homesupplies.com.
C,,,"Okay hold on, let me go get my phone because I already took a photo of the cutting board yesterday so I should have it on my phone right here."
C,,,Hold on.
C,,,"Okay, uh so that's support@homesupplies.com."
C,,,Okay sent.
C,,,Can you see it?
A,NA,,"Okay, let me check."
A,NA,,"Okay yes, I got it."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"Um, by the way Amber, do you also have the photo of the barcode of the cutting board?"
C,,,Is that really necessary?
C,,,I'm not lying.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"Yes Amber, I would need it to have your reshipment approved as soon as possible."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"After that, we will ship the oven to you immediately and you should receive it within 24 hours."
C,,,Okay let me go upstairs and take a photo.
C,,,Can you hold?
A,NA,,"Sure, take your time."
C,,,"Hello, are you there?"

C,,,"No, that can't be right."
C,,,I am literally holding my bill right now and it says July.
C,,,And it says 33 dollars in big bold letters.

C,,,I don't know.
C,,,All I know is that you're overcharging me and it's written on my paper bill.
A,NA,,Yes John.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,"I also checked your other month's charges this year from January to July 2020 and all of these months, you were only charged 30."

A,NA,,"Oh no problem, It happens."

A,Account Verification,Positive,May I ask for the original online order number?
C,,,"Okay, let me see."
C,,,"Alright, Please wait for a moment."
C,,,"Okay, I believe it's 01714257893."

A,NA,,"Just to verify, that's 01714257893."
C,,,"Yes, that's right."
A,Engagement,Positive,I do apologize but the one that you provided is actually not accepting towards our database.
A,Account Verification,Positive,Do you actually have a number that starts with triple 0 7 or 7?
A,Account Verification,Positive,"Or, can I ask for your first and last name so I can manually check it in our database?"
C,,,Yeah. I'm not sure about a triple 0 something.
C,,,"In a way, it's Adam Wilson."
A,Engagement,Positive,"Alright, thank you so much Wilson."
A,NA,,"This is spelled as W for whiskey, I for India, L for Lima, S for Sierra, O for Oscar, and N for November."

A,Account Verification,Positive,"Okay, let me just quickly look into a portal and check any notes in your order."
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,Do you still have the return tracking from the courier company when you returned the item?
C,,,Not sure.
C,,,Is it the 74391?
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,That's actually the return authorization from Coats and Gowns.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,"When you returned the item to the courier company for shipping, this should have provided you with the return tracking."
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,Do you still have that?
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,It's actually printed in the upper right part of the receipt.
C,,,"Okay, I probably have to take it up okay."
C,,,I imagine I have it somewhere but it might take some time to look for that.
A,NA,,"Oh, I see."
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,"Anyway, I tried to search for your name and nothing is coming up."
A,Account Verification,Positive,Can I ask for the order under your name originally?

A,NA,,Is that correct?

C,,,"Okay, that should be adam_wilson@millfence.com."
A,Engagement,Positive,Thank you.
A,NA,,"So again, it's adam_wilson@millfence.com."

A,Engagement,Positive,Okay?
C,,,"Sure, no problem."
A,Engagement,Positive,"Alright, okay, thank you for patiently waiting Adam. "
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,Now I can actually see here that you have called the quality informers that you'd like to return the item on the 15th of November.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,Is that correct?
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,"Yes, now did you return the item to company in the same day that you called?"
C,,,Probably close to it.
C,,,I'm not really sure if it's on the same day though.
C,,,But probably just close to that day.
A,Engagement,Positive,I understand.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"However, I've been checking the date that you actually called in for the return."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,It's already beyond the timeframe that we ask for refunds.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,So what we'll do is I'll go ahead and forward this information to our corporate office and I'll have them check and update you directly about the refund.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"So, please expect an email within 2 to 4 business days."
A,Engagement,Positive,Is that okay with you?
C,,,2 to 4 business days?
A,NA,,"Yes, no worries I will send it to to them right now."
C,,,Alright Alright.
C,,,"First, I thought that it will probably be like 3 to 5 weeks to process."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,Oh no no no don't don't worry Adam it's only 2 to 4 business days.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,"So, you already checked your account and nothing has been credited yet in the card ending in 753."
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,Is that right?
C,,,Nothing yet.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,Okay I understand and I'll go ahead and forward them the details that I have here.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"So I'll send the email to adam_wilson@millfence.com, correct?;"

A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"Alright, well here are a few reasons to consider purchasing today."
