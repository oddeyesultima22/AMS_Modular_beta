5.00,9.00,Agent, Thank you for calling Summit Gear. My name is Chris.
9.00,11.00,Agent, How may I assist you?
11.00,20.00,Customer, Hi Chris. I ordered a winter jacket from your website and when it arrived it had a big stain on the sleeve.
20.00,27.00,Agent," Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Was the package damaged when you received it?"
27.00,33.00,Customer," No, it wasn't. I noticed the stain after I took it out of the plastic in the box."
33.00,36.00,Customer, The packaging was perfectly fine.
36.00,41.00,Agent, I see. Do you have your order number available?
41.00,44.00,Customer," Yes, just a second."
44.00,52.00,Customer, The order number is 0.03894.701.
52.00,56.00,Agent, Thank you. Let me pull it up on my screen. Just a moment please.
56.00,59.00,Agent, Thanks.
59.00,62.00,Agent, Could I confirm your full name please?
62.00,65.00,Customer," Yes, it's Diana Stone."
65.00,70.00,Agent," Thank you, Miss Stone. I'm looking at your order."
70.00,75.00,Agent, This was for the woman's snow trek parka in Sage Green. Is that correct?
75.00,81.00,Customer," Yes, that's it. How long will it take to replace the jacket?"
81.00,87.00,Agent, We can ship it out as soon as we receive the return item.
87.00,92.00,Agent, Could I email you a shipping label to print out?
92.00,100.00,Customer," So, I print out the label and mail it back in the original box. Do I have to pay for the shipping?"
100.00,108.00,Agent," No, we will credit your account for the shipping. You can use the original box if it is still intact."
108.00,113.00,Customer, I understand. Then you'll send me another jacket?
113.00,121.00,Agent," Yes, let me just double check. We still have that size and color in stock."
121.00,124.00,Customer," Okay, thanks."
124.00,131.00,Agent," Hello, Miss Stone. I checked our inventory and we do have your size."
131.00,139.00,Agent," Unfortunately, we only have the jacket in Ocean Blue or Foggy Gray."
139.00,146.00,Customer," Oh, I see. I really like the green color. That's too bad."
146.00,150.00,Agent, It was a very popular color this season.
150.00,156.00,Customer," Okay, give me a second. I'll go with the ocean blue."
156.00,165.00,Agent," Alright, thank you, ma'am. We will send you another snow track parka jacket in the ocean blue."
165.00,169.00,Customer, I'll send the stain jacket back this afternoon.
169.00,177.00,Agent," Thank you, Miss Stone. Also, may I confirm your email address so I can send you the shipping label?"
177.00,188.00,Customer," Yeah, sure. The address is Diana dot stone, 99 at gmail.com."
188.00,200.00,Agent," Thank you, Miss Stone. Let me just repeat that back. It's Diana dot stone, 99 at gmail.com."
200.00,203.00,Customer," Yes, that's right."
203.00,208.00,Agent, Thank you. I will send you the label within the next five minutes.
208.00,210.00,Customer, That sounds good.
210.00,214.00,Agent, Is there anything else I can help you with today?
214.00,219.00,Customer," No, that'll do it. Sorry. Could I have your name again?"
