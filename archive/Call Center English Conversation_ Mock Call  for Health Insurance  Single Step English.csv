214.10,216.10,Customer, How may I assist you today?
216.10,222.10,Customer," Hi. I have a few questions about my health insurance, specifically regarding mental health coverage."

249.10,256.10,Customer," Absolutely, Monique. Your plan includes coverage for mental health services, including therapy and counseling."
256.10,263.10,Customer," Depending on the specifics of the provider and type of service, you may have a co-payment or co-insurance."
263.10,269.10,Customer, I can check your specific benefits if you provide me with the names of any mental health professionals you're considering.
269.10,271.10,Customer, That's good to know.
271.10,278.10,Customer," Second question. If I need to see a psychiatrist for medication management, how does that work with my insurance?"
278.10,287.10,Customer," That's an important aspect of mental health care. If you need to consult with a psychiatrist for medication management, it falls under your behavioral health coverage."
287.10,296.10,Customer," Keep in mind, you may need a referral from your primary care physician, and any medications prescribed will be subject to your prescription drug benefits."
296.10,302.10,Customer, How can I get more information about which drugs are covered under my insurance plan?
302.10,311.10,Customer," If you do a search on our homepage, there is a list of drugs that are covered under each plan. You can also do a search for specific drugs to see if they are covered."
311.10,320.10,Customer," Got it. Lastly, I've heard about telehealth options for mental health services. Does my plan cover virtual therapy sessions?"
320.10,327.10,Customer," Yes, Monique. Your plan does offer coverage for virtual therapy sessions through telehealth services."
327.10,338.10,Customer," It's a convenient option, especially in today's digital age. The same cost-sharing rules apply, but it provides flexibility for accessing mental health care from the comfort of your home."
338.10,342.10,Customer, Thank you for the information. That's really good to know.
342.10,349.10,Customer," You're welcome, Monique. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help."
