,,,
20,27,Agent," Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Was the package damaged when you received it?"
,,,
27,33,Customer," No, it wasn't. I noticed the stain after I took it out of the plastic in the box."
,,,

,,,
87,92,Agent, Could I email you a shipping label to print out?
,,,
92,100,Customer," So, I print out the label and mail it back in the original box. Do I have to pay for the shipping?"
,,,
100,108,Agent," No, we will credit your account for the shipping. You can use the original box if it is still intact."
,,,
108,113,Customer, I understand. Then you'll send me another jacket?
,,,
113,121,Agent," Yes, let me just double check. We still have that size and color in stock."

124,131,Agent," Hello, Miss Stone. I checked our inventory and we do have your size."
,,,
131,139,Agent," Unfortunately, we only have the jacket in Ocean Blue or Foggy Gray."
,,,
139,146,Customer," Oh, I see. I really like the green color. That's too bad."
,,,
146,150,Agent, It was a very popular color this season.

150,156,Customer," Okay, give me a second. I'll go with the ocean blue."
