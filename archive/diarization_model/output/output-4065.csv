0.00,2.00,SPEAKER_00," Okay, how are you?"
2.00,5.00,SPEAKER_02," I'm pretty good, I have strange deal."
5.00,6.00,SPEAKER_02, What's that all about?
6.00,27.40,SPEAKER_00," Well, you know, I came across on a computer mailing list on my email from, it's a research thing for cycle linguistics and you pen, they're building a linguistic database of many languages and so they were offering free phone calls anywhere in the world."
27.40,30.40,SPEAKER_00, We have to only speak one language though.
30.40,40.60,SPEAKER_00, So they're collecting lots of different languages but you have to only speak the two parties have to speak the same language so I could only call in native English speaker.
40.60,41.60,SPEAKER_00, That was the question.
41.60,42.60,SPEAKER_00, I can't throw it.
42.60,44.60,SPEAKER_00, You shouldn't be throwing in lots of German.
44.60,45.60,SPEAKER_02, I should be.
45.60,46.60,SPEAKER_02, I should not be.
46.60,52.00,SPEAKER_00, I know that will be hard but I decided to go for it.
52.00,56.40,SPEAKER_00, And then doing formal and French and German and all different.
56.40,59.40,SPEAKER_02," I mean, they're really going to record this and really going to use it for something"
59.40,61.40,SPEAKER_00," or? Yeah, I guess so."
61.40,81.64,SPEAKER_00," My guess is that it's either for doing some sort of speech recognition systems for computers or for building up, there's a field computational linguistics where they look at the properties of languages, what the probabilities of are various kinds of words occurring together and such."
81.64,82.64,SPEAKER_00, And all of that.
82.64,83.64,SPEAKER_02, It turns them on.
83.64,84.64,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, yeah."
84.64,86.84,SPEAKER_00, I know what it's for and they need a lot of it.
86.84,89.36,SPEAKER_02," Anyway, thank you very much for your note."
89.36,94.36,SPEAKER_02," After card and your photo, a couple weeks ago and I've lied."
94.36,95.36,SPEAKER_00, What?
95.36,96.36,SPEAKER_00, She's coming along.
96.36,98.16,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, she's a big girl."
98.16,100.24,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, and how are your grandkids?"
100.24,101.88,SPEAKER_02," Well, pretty good."
101.88,103.28,SPEAKER_00, Are they both for now?
103.28,104.52,SPEAKER_00, Did you have the second one?
104.52,107.48,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, yeah, she had the second one in March."
107.48,109.32,SPEAKER_02, And so he's about three months old.
109.32,110.32,SPEAKER_00, Wow.
110.32,111.32,SPEAKER_02, And his name is Sebastian.
111.32,112.32,SPEAKER_00, That's nice.
112.32,113.32,SPEAKER_02, He's a nice boy.
113.32,114.32,SPEAKER_02, He's a good fellow.
114.32,115.32,SPEAKER_02, He's coming along.
115.32,121.08,SPEAKER_02," And of course, Patrick is talking and walking and he's saying he's two."
121.08,122.08,SPEAKER_02, Wow.
122.08,125.68,SPEAKER_02," He was a middle of June, which is second birthday."
125.68,130.28,SPEAKER_02, So he's a big boy and he's doing all kinds of things that people do when they're two.
130.28,131.28,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
131.28,133.32,SPEAKER_00, Like being disagreeable and asserting and debate.
133.32,134.32,SPEAKER_00, He's not.
134.32,138.44,SPEAKER_02," He's pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, but most of the time, yeah."
138.44,146.84,SPEAKER_02," But you know, saying things and being kind of funny and walking around and just being nice, nice little boy."
146.84,147.84,SPEAKER_02, That's me.
147.84,148.84,SPEAKER_02, I'm happy.
148.84,149.84,SPEAKER_02, I'm happy.
149.84,150.84,SPEAKER_02, What?
150.84,151.84,SPEAKER_00, And she's happy.
151.84,153.24,SPEAKER_02," Oh, she's fine."
153.24,154.24,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
154.24,158.68,SPEAKER_02," You know, the apartment's a little bit small and stuff and they could, you know, we could use this and use that."
158.68,161.44,SPEAKER_02," But all in all, sure."
161.44,162.44,SPEAKER_02, She's fine.
162.44,163.44,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
163.44,164.44,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
164.44,165.44,SPEAKER_00, How are you doing?
165.44,166.44,SPEAKER_00, We're fine.
166.44,167.44,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
167.44,172.44,SPEAKER_00, I'm not getting to get more fussy because she can walk now and.
172.44,174.44,SPEAKER_02," Well, she's what I will know 10 months."
174.44,177.44,SPEAKER_02," But she's, that's very early for walking."
177.44,178.44,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
178.44,183.44,SPEAKER_00," Sam's cousin, our niece, not Sam's sister's, best is cousin."
183.44,187.44,SPEAKER_00, Sam's sister's kid also walked at nine months.
187.44,190.44,SPEAKER_00, So she's been walking for about five weeks now.
190.44,191.44,SPEAKER_00," Oh, that's a good question."
191.44,197.44,SPEAKER_00," And she can climb stairs, she climbs on chairs and, you know, we have to put her know a lot more now."
197.44,198.44,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
198.44,199.44,SPEAKER_00, And she remembers things.
199.44,202.44,SPEAKER_00, So we can't distract her as easily anymore.
202.44,210.44,SPEAKER_00," So she's had a few little proto temper tantrums, you know, things like if she was, she's unrolling all the toilet paper."
210.44,212.44,SPEAKER_00, She just thought this was wonderful.
212.44,215.44,SPEAKER_00," And it was funny, but I didn't let it away."
215.44,224.44,SPEAKER_00, And she just put her hands on her hips and started crying and she had this pout and that we've had a few of those this week that started.
224.44,227.44,SPEAKER_00," So, but then she remembers, she doesn't go back."
227.44,228.44,SPEAKER_02, Life is tough.
228.44,229.44,SPEAKER_02, Life is fun.
229.44,232.44,SPEAKER_00," I know, we're getting her, we're breaking her spirit early."
232.44,235.44,SPEAKER_00," We're a girl, my goodness."
235.44,239.44,SPEAKER_00, She understands the number of words now.
239.44,241.44,SPEAKER_00," You know, it surprises me."
241.44,246.44,SPEAKER_00," Like the other day I said, do you want to go upstairs and change it and get a clean diaper or something like that."
246.44,249.44,SPEAKER_00, And she stopped what she was doing and went over to the stairs.
249.44,253.44,SPEAKER_00, And I don't know what piece of that she understood diaper or stairs or what.
253.44,263.44,SPEAKER_00," But some things are getting through and she has said her first word, which was Kitty, Kitty Cat, which is our cat."
263.44,266.44,SPEAKER_00, I don't know that you know that it's a general word.
266.44,268.44,SPEAKER_00, It's sort of a proper noun.
268.44,280.44,SPEAKER_00, And she's all of a sudden after months of saying pet the Kitty gently and showing her how she's petting her gently instead of just grabbing her and trying to put her in her mouth.
280.44,284.44,SPEAKER_02," So, how did she get to be a year?"
284.44,285.44,SPEAKER_00, August 24th.
285.44,288.44,SPEAKER_00," So, yeah, end of August."
288.44,293.44,SPEAKER_00, She's spirited and determined.
293.44,297.44,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, she's very headstrong."
297.44,304.44,SPEAKER_00," Her daycare people say whenever there's a conflict between the two kids, two kids a daycare, that's always wins."
304.44,310.94,SPEAKER_00," Even though she's much smaller than these other kids, she's just very focused and very determined."
310.94,311.94,SPEAKER_00, She doesn't cry.
311.94,313.94,SPEAKER_00, She doesn't look at another kid.
313.94,319.00,SPEAKER_00," She just goes for the toy that they're holding, you know, and she'll put that until she gets it."
319.00,322.94,SPEAKER_00, And then the not-nice part of this that I'm sure will get better of age.
322.94,329.94,SPEAKER_00, I hope she'll play with the toy as long as the other kids interested and when they're no longer interested she throws it away.
329.94,333.94,SPEAKER_00," So, there's a little malicious side in here."
333.94,334.94,SPEAKER_00, I will.
334.94,335.94,SPEAKER_00, I don't know.
335.94,336.94,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
336.94,337.94,SPEAKER_00, And I'll work.
337.94,340.94,SPEAKER_02, We'll get to analytical about it.
340.94,348.94,SPEAKER_02, I've seen these teen kids with terrible things when they were really young and they grow up to be very different from the people.
348.94,357.14,SPEAKER_00," Well, I also feel that it's probably better this way because you can train hard to not be nasty."
357.14,361.94,SPEAKER_00, More easily you can train a shy kid to stand up for herself.
361.94,362.94,SPEAKER_00, Right.
362.94,363.94,SPEAKER_00, I think she'll be okay.
363.94,365.94,SPEAKER_02, How was your teaching going?
365.94,366.94,SPEAKER_00, It's hectic.
366.94,367.94,SPEAKER_00," Well, I'm not doing it right now."
367.94,368.94,SPEAKER_00, I'm off for summer.
368.94,371.94,SPEAKER_00," Oh, yeah, but I mean doing the year."
371.94,374.94,SPEAKER_00, I found it much more difficult with this.
374.94,375.94,SPEAKER_00, Of course.
375.94,381.94,SPEAKER_00, I treat it much more as a job instead of my life now.
381.94,384.78,SPEAKER_00, It's just no longer the central thing.
384.78,394.20,SPEAKER_00, But my course was a course in normal language acquisition being taught to students of communicative who were majoring in communicative disorders.
394.20,398.20,SPEAKER_00, So there's students who are going to go on in practice.
398.20,400.20,SPEAKER_00, And so they're not very theoretically oriented.
400.20,402.20,SPEAKER_00, They're applied oriented.
402.20,407.20,SPEAKER_00, And they're not as good as my students at San Diego.
407.20,408.20,SPEAKER_00, But they can learn.
408.20,411.20,SPEAKER_00, It was a writing intensive course.
411.20,417.20,SPEAKER_00," All of these kids, they were undergrads, but they have to go to graduate practice."
417.20,420.20,SPEAKER_00, You can't practice without a master's.
420.20,422.20,SPEAKER_00, So they knew they had to go to graduate school.
422.20,424.20,SPEAKER_00, So they really did work very hard.
424.20,426.20,SPEAKER_00, They knew they had to get a B and at midterms.
426.20,430.20,SPEAKER_00, Almost all of them had C's and D's.
430.20,431.20,SPEAKER_00, And so they pulled it up.
431.20,433.20,SPEAKER_00," They worked very, very hard."
433.20,435.20,SPEAKER_00, And that was rewarding.
435.20,439.20,SPEAKER_00, I'll have to teach two courses instead of one in the fall.
439.20,442.20,SPEAKER_00," Well, I'm not looking forward to that."
442.20,443.20,SPEAKER_00, But it's okay.
443.20,446.20,SPEAKER_00, My research has slowed down tremendously.
446.20,448.20,SPEAKER_00, And that's bothering you a little more.
448.20,450.20,SPEAKER_00, I'm trying to write over the summer.
450.20,452.20,SPEAKER_00, But I've got about five papers to write.
452.20,456.20,SPEAKER_00, And I'll probably get two and a half done.
456.20,459.20,SPEAKER_00, And I would love to get a grant out.
459.20,461.20,SPEAKER_00, But I don't know when that will be.
461.20,463.20,SPEAKER_00, It's not going to be the summer.
463.20,464.20,SPEAKER_02, How is Sam doing?
464.20,466.20,SPEAKER_02, How is that college?
466.20,469.20,SPEAKER_00, He's doing OK.
469.20,474.20,SPEAKER_00, The college is having problems keeping its enrollments up.
474.20,481.20,SPEAKER_00, And so we've been a little worried that at one point it looked like they might lay off some untenured people.
481.20,483.20,SPEAKER_00, And in the end they didn't do that.
483.20,486.20,SPEAKER_00, And they're doing stupid things.
486.20,491.20,SPEAKER_00," They want to start a football team, which is a considerable financial investment."
491.20,495.20,SPEAKER_00," At the same time, they were talking about laying off faculty."
495.20,502.20,SPEAKER_00, And they think that by having a football team they'll generate more interest amongst undergraduates and more enrollments.
502.20,508.20,SPEAKER_00, And I think that at a school with a population of 700 that's not the best way to spend your money.
508.20,511.20,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, I did never going to be good football team."
511.20,512.20,SPEAKER_02," Oh, man."
512.20,513.20,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, it's not."
513.20,514.20,SPEAKER_00, Poor that.
514.20,516.20,SPEAKER_02, That is amazing.
516.20,518.20,SPEAKER_00, It's kind of anti-intellectual.
518.20,520.20,SPEAKER_02," Oh, it's just so American."
520.20,521.20,SPEAKER_02, It hurts.
521.20,522.20,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
522.20,523.20,SPEAKER_00, It's not.
523.20,526.20,SPEAKER_00, This is a real anti-intellectual environment here.
526.20,527.20,SPEAKER_00, That's weird.
527.20,529.20,SPEAKER_00, Even amongst academics.
529.20,534.20,SPEAKER_00, But it's so different from anywhere I've been before.
534.20,542.20,SPEAKER_00," I didn't know if the rules of this call let me put on another caller, but I figured at the 15-minute point I'd put Sam on."
542.20,544.20,SPEAKER_00, And he can tell you more about that.
544.20,545.20,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
545.20,546.20,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
546.20,547.20,SPEAKER_00, How are you guys?
547.20,548.20,SPEAKER_00, How's Chris?
548.20,549.20,SPEAKER_02," Well, pretty well."
549.20,550.20,SPEAKER_02, Chris is not here at the moment.
550.20,557.20,SPEAKER_02," She's been away with her class up around Blinded Borg for about two weeks on a, they call, FED, Messon."
557.20,559.20,SPEAKER_02," FED, Messon is surveying."
559.20,561.20,SPEAKER_02, And so she's been away for two weeks.
561.20,562.20,SPEAKER_02, She's come back tonight.
562.20,563.20,SPEAKER_00, Ah.
563.20,564.20,SPEAKER_02, So we're looking forward to that.
564.20,565.20,SPEAKER_00," Oh, yeah."
565.20,566.20,SPEAKER_00," Oh, gosh."
566.20,567.20,SPEAKER_00, I bet you're getting lonely.
567.20,568.20,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
568.20,569.20,SPEAKER_02," Well, Claudia's been here."
569.20,570.20,SPEAKER_02, And we've been doing OK.
570.20,576.20,SPEAKER_02, And I'm actually waiting for Claudia to show up because we're supposed to go into town and meet some people in town.
576.20,580.20,SPEAKER_02, I've got a student here who's looking to check in our rooms and stuff.
580.20,582.20,SPEAKER_02," She's coming in the fall, but she was in a place called Talwah."
582.20,583.20,SPEAKER_02, So Tuff says this.
583.20,584.20,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
584.20,585.20,SPEAKER_00, She spent her at Talwah.
585.20,586.20,SPEAKER_02, She was there.
586.20,592.20,SPEAKER_02," She did a course in Talwah, and then she came over here and checked out her room here."
592.20,594.20,SPEAKER_02, So it's any end semester is still going.
594.20,597.20,SPEAKER_02, Of course it ends on the 22nd of July.
597.20,600.20,SPEAKER_02, So it's a thing to visit.
600.20,601.20,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
601.20,602.20,SPEAKER_00, Got another month.
602.20,605.20,SPEAKER_00, And then are you coming over to the States at all this summer?
605.20,606.20,SPEAKER_00, No.
606.20,607.20,SPEAKER_00, No.
607.20,608.20,SPEAKER_00, No.
608.20,609.20,SPEAKER_02, Oh.
609.20,610.20,SPEAKER_02, No.
610.20,611.20,SPEAKER_00, No.
611.20,613.20,SPEAKER_00, I don't know if she's left here anymore.
613.20,615.20,SPEAKER_02," Well, the relative scene is kind of sad."
615.20,617.20,SPEAKER_02," You know, everybody's kind of passed away."
617.20,618.20,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
618.20,620.20,SPEAKER_00, I remember when I talked to you in the fall.
620.20,621.20,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
621.20,623.20,SPEAKER_00, Did you sister die?
623.20,624.20,SPEAKER_02, My sister passed away.
624.20,625.20,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
625.20,628.20,SPEAKER_02, I don't know if she's booked me before that or was that what's happening or?
628.20,629.20,SPEAKER_00, When was it?
629.20,630.20,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
630.20,633.20,SPEAKER_00, I made them right after my father died right after we talked.
633.20,634.20,SPEAKER_00," Oh, God."
634.20,635.20,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
635.20,636.20,SPEAKER_00, We're getting old.
636.20,637.20,SPEAKER_00, No.
637.20,639.20,SPEAKER_02, It's I don't know what it is.
639.20,642.20,SPEAKER_02, And people get sick and they get sick pretty young.
642.20,643.20,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
643.20,649.20,SPEAKER_02," And you know, my sister wasn't that old and she just had bad luck, I guess it's all you can say."
649.20,651.20,SPEAKER_00, I'm going to put your wallet up.
651.20,653.20,SPEAKER_02, I'll put anything anybody could do.
653.20,658.20,SPEAKER_02," So and then an ad, an ad of Chris's ad made me up in Maine, passed away."
658.20,660.20,SPEAKER_00, That that had an ad.
660.20,661.20,SPEAKER_00, Have that happened already?
661.20,662.20,SPEAKER_02," No, that had not happened."
662.20,665.20,SPEAKER_02," No, she passed away in about March or."
665.20,666.20,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
666.20,670.20,SPEAKER_00," There was some concern about her when I talked to you in September, or October."
670.20,672.20,SPEAKER_02," No, she's been she was not doing well."
672.20,675.20,SPEAKER_02, She had a brain tumor and operated on and things weren't going well.
675.20,677.20,SPEAKER_02, I actually got to see her.
677.20,679.20,SPEAKER_02, I guess a day before she died.
679.20,680.20,SPEAKER_02," I mean, she didn't know."
680.20,681.20,SPEAKER_02, She didn't know that that I was there.
681.20,682.20,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, that was you."
682.20,683.20,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
683.20,685.20,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, she was just not not in."
685.20,687.20,SPEAKER_02," So it was a blessing, I guess."
687.20,689.20,SPEAKER_02," But anyway, weird stuff."
689.20,690.20,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
690.20,692.20,SPEAKER_00, And how about you?
692.20,695.20,SPEAKER_00, Because how about how you're eyes?
695.20,696.20,SPEAKER_02," Well, I don't know."
696.20,699.20,SPEAKER_02," I have to go next week to see check out, you know, see again."
699.20,703.20,SPEAKER_02, I'm not exactly convinced that it's OK.
703.20,707.20,SPEAKER_02," You know, it's I I'm not it's not sure."
707.20,709.20,SPEAKER_02, It's been it's been pretty good.
709.20,712.20,SPEAKER_02, It was about 80% for a while.
712.20,715.20,SPEAKER_02, And then I'm not exactly sure what it is now.
715.20,717.20,SPEAKER_02," Well, I don't know a couple of it."
717.20,719.20,SPEAKER_00, So are you having blurred vision or?
719.20,720.20,SPEAKER_02," Oh, yeah."
720.20,721.20,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, sure."
721.20,722.20,SPEAKER_02, Right.
722.20,725.20,SPEAKER_02, I is not so great.
725.20,727.20,SPEAKER_02, And it was he we've got back to about 80%.
727.20,729.20,SPEAKER_02," You know, it was it was a detached retina."
729.20,730.20,SPEAKER_00, Right.
730.20,733.20,SPEAKER_02, And then they operated on it once and they operate on it twice.
733.20,737.20,SPEAKER_02, And then it seems seems to be seem to be doing pretty well.
737.20,741.20,SPEAKER_02," And at the moment, I'm a little not so secure."
741.20,743.20,SPEAKER_02, So who knows.
743.20,748.20,SPEAKER_02," But you know, it'll never be more than about 70 or 80% which is five 80% of the asset."
748.20,749.20,SPEAKER_02, Right.
749.20,752.20,SPEAKER_02, So just would you see.
752.20,754.20,SPEAKER_00, What happened?
754.20,755.20,SPEAKER_00, That's straight.
755.20,762.20,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, knowing and the thing that came up recently, you know, I had I had kind of a knee problem a couple of years ago."
762.20,764.20,SPEAKER_02, And my right knee now is my left knee.
764.20,765.20,SPEAKER_02," It's just you know, it's just a pain."
765.20,766.20,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
766.20,770.20,SPEAKER_02, I went to the doctor and they take to a pump.
770.20,771.20,, Pump.
771.20,772.20,SPEAKER_02, Pumps your own.
772.20,775.20,SPEAKER_02," Each by the way, I just think anyway, they take a fluid out of it."
775.20,779.20,SPEAKER_02, I think we get irritated and take some pills and stuff.
779.20,782.20,SPEAKER_00, And it's just just is it's it's it's that like water on the knee?
782.20,783.20,SPEAKER_00, Is that what that is?
783.20,784.20,SPEAKER_02," Well, that's what happens."
784.20,788.20,SPEAKER_02, It develops because of irritation because of the inflammation.
788.20,791.20,SPEAKER_02, Is that how the inflammation is?
791.20,794.20,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, maybe I mean they they don't know."
794.20,795.20,SPEAKER_00, Mm hmm.
795.20,797.20,SPEAKER_02, It just came overnight practically.
797.20,798.20,SPEAKER_02, Wow.
798.20,802.20,SPEAKER_02, And we'd been up in Berlin and we had a big trip over there.
802.20,805.20,SPEAKER_02, I've been to a lot of a lot of walking on the fast walking stuff at that.
805.20,809.20,SPEAKER_02," You know, I mean that shouldn't be it should be a big deal."
809.20,812.20,SPEAKER_00," Was this last trip of tough, it tough days?"
812.20,813.20,SPEAKER_00, Good.
813.20,816.20,SPEAKER_00, Was your last time of students from toughs good?
816.20,818.20,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, well, they're still here."
818.20,820.20,SPEAKER_00," Right, but they're winding down so you know that they're well."
820.20,821.20,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, they're very good."
821.20,822.20,SPEAKER_02, They learned they learned a lot of German.
822.20,824.20,SPEAKER_02, They learned amazing my German.
824.20,827.20,SPEAKER_02," Before I forget, I saw George Salinas a couple days ago."
827.20,831.20,SPEAKER_02," And he's had well, he's working for an American firm over here."
831.20,833.20,SPEAKER_02," He's doing very, very well."
833.20,835.20,SPEAKER_02, And his wife just had their fourth child.
835.20,836.20,SPEAKER_02, Wow.
836.20,837.20,SPEAKER_00, For the mopoy Benjamin.
837.20,839.20,SPEAKER_02, Wow.
839.20,842.20,SPEAKER_02, About two weeks ago maybe.
842.20,843.20,SPEAKER_02, Hmmm.
843.20,846.20,SPEAKER_02, And I got a card from you and Bremie Gleason.
846.20,847.20,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
847.20,848.20,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
848.20,849.20,SPEAKER_02," Well, she just had a baby a couple of..."
849.20,851.20,SPEAKER_00, I think I heard that.
851.20,852.20,SPEAKER_02," Well, this is number two."
852.20,855.20,SPEAKER_00," Okay, I just got a card from Ron and Doris."
855.20,856.20,SPEAKER_00, Oh.
856.20,858.20,SPEAKER_00, And they see Amy Gleason on occasion.
858.20,860.20,SPEAKER_00, And so I think they can tell me that.
860.20,862.20,SPEAKER_00, Have you heard from Ron and Doris?
862.20,863.20,SPEAKER_00," No, no, no."
863.20,865.20,SPEAKER_00, They are now living in Rhode Island.
865.20,866.20,SPEAKER_00, You probably knew that.
866.20,868.20,SPEAKER_02," Well, yeah, she's teaching as you are."
868.20,873.20,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, and it was a very nice letter because it sounded like she went through very similar things that I did."
873.20,876.20,SPEAKER_00," You know, I went from Chicago to UCSD to here."
876.20,877.20,SPEAKER_00, Right.
877.20,880.20,SPEAKER_00, And it's just such an intellectual left down.
880.20,884.20,SPEAKER_00, And she went from Penn to Columbia to Columbia to URI.
884.20,885.20,SPEAKER_00, Columbia to URI.
885.20,886.20,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
886.20,889.20,SPEAKER_00," And she said the students are just, you know, they don't care."
889.20,890.20,SPEAKER_00, And they're not very good.
890.20,893.20,SPEAKER_00, And all the students who are getting conference papers rejected.
893.20,898.20,SPEAKER_00, And she thinks it's the affiliation because she doesn't think equality of her work has changed.
898.20,908.20,SPEAKER_00," Now, I haven't submitted a conference paper with the Missouri affiliation yet because the last one I submitted was in the fall."
908.20,911.20,SPEAKER_00, And I still had my San Diego affiliation.
911.20,913.20,SPEAKER_00," In fact, I'm still officially on leave."
913.20,917.20,SPEAKER_00," If anything came up in the next year, we could go back for Sam."
917.20,921.20,SPEAKER_00," But I think it's very, very, very, very, very unlikely."
921.20,931.20,SPEAKER_00," But anyway, it was nice to hear from her because she said after two years there now, she have come to terms with this."
931.20,936.20,SPEAKER_00, And she accepted that there's a lot of good things in Rhode Island.
936.20,940.20,SPEAKER_00, And their life is a lot less complicated.
940.20,942.20,SPEAKER_00, And she is more to have to be apparent.
942.20,946.20,SPEAKER_00, And she's just not going to have the same kind of career that she had thought about.
946.20,952.20,SPEAKER_00, Ron is working as a financial consultant for Merrill Lynch.
952.20,958.20,SPEAKER_00, And he had been doing work for some environmental firm as a consultant.
958.20,961.20,SPEAKER_00, And it didn't work out.
961.20,965.20,SPEAKER_00, He was changing projects every couple of weeks.
965.20,968.20,SPEAKER_00, And he said he couldn't keep on top of it.
968.20,973.20,SPEAKER_00, He couldn't learn the whole new area that fast each time.
973.20,975.20,SPEAKER_00, And he went and had some tests.
975.20,984.20,SPEAKER_00," And he was diagnosed as having a tension deficit disorder, which, you know, given how far he's gotten, you know, it goes to agree a tough and all."
984.20,989.20,SPEAKER_00," I found that surprising that for the first time as an adult, they're diagnosing this."
989.20,992.20,SPEAKER_02," I wonder about it, but anyway."
992.20,995.20,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, but that's what he said."
995.20,997.20,SPEAKER_00, Whatever is helpful.
997.20,998.20,SPEAKER_00, Right.
998.20,1002.20,SPEAKER_00, So he found this new job as a financial consultant and seems to be happy with that.
1002.20,1006.20,SPEAKER_00, And then he saw Leo and Julie at Crete High.
1006.20,1008.20,SPEAKER_00, And they're doing great.
1008.20,1010.20,SPEAKER_00," They had just used New York now, right?"
1010.20,1012.20,SPEAKER_00, Really nice house in Westchester.
1012.20,1013.20,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1013.20,1018.20,SPEAKER_00," An older home that, you know, Julie is of course carving up and making beautiful."
1018.20,1024.20,SPEAKER_00, Now she had a job with an architectural group when she first got out to New York.
1024.20,1026.20,SPEAKER_00, And that didn't work out.
1026.20,1030.20,SPEAKER_00, She said they had her doing things that she really wasn't qualified to do.
1030.20,1033.20,SPEAKER_00, And that she really didn't feel competent doing.
1033.20,1036.20,SPEAKER_00, And they mutually agreed that she should leave.
1036.20,1038.20,SPEAKER_00, And so she was looking for another job.
1038.20,1041.20,SPEAKER_00, And I'm sure she'll find one.
1041.20,1042.20,SPEAKER_00, She's so talented.
1042.20,1043.20,SPEAKER_00, She may have found one.
1043.20,1044.20,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1044.20,1045.20,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1045.20,1053.20,SPEAKER_00," And so we met Adrienne, their kid who was for me and just a really lovely little boy."
1053.20,1055.20,SPEAKER_00, She felt big.
1055.20,1056.20,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1056.20,1057.20,SPEAKER_00, He's got Leo's feet.
1057.20,1058.20,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1058.20,1061.20,SPEAKER_00, And Ron and Doris sent us a picture of theirs.
1061.20,1063.20,SPEAKER_00, And he has Ron's expressions.
1063.20,1064.20,SPEAKER_00, He really looks like Ron.
1064.20,1069.20,SPEAKER_00, And he looked really big too in this picture three and a half.
1069.20,1075.20,SPEAKER_00, But Leo and Julie just seemed so happy with the decisions they've made.
1075.20,1076.20,SPEAKER_00, Good.
1076.20,1079.20,SPEAKER_02, Now is he with a publishing house?
1079.20,1080.20,SPEAKER_02, Which one?
1080.20,1081.20,SPEAKER_00, Which one?
1081.20,1084.20,SPEAKER_02," Well, I think that, yeah, it's one of these sort of universities."
1084.20,1085.20,SPEAKER_02, The public university books.
1085.20,1087.20,SPEAKER_00, He's a heart- heart-brace.
1087.20,1088.20,SPEAKER_00, I'm not sure.
1088.20,1089.20,SPEAKER_00, Oh.
1089.20,1091.20,SPEAKER_00, I have two friends in publishing.
1091.20,1096.20,SPEAKER_00, And maybe the other one that just took the job with heart-court-brace.
1096.20,1098.20,SPEAKER_00, I don't remember which one.
1098.20,1099.20,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1099.20,1102.20,SPEAKER_02," Anyway, he's enjoying it and liking it and they're doing okay."
1102.20,1103.20,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1103.20,1106.20,SPEAKER_00, He seems to feel really like he's doing the right thing.
1106.20,1108.20,SPEAKER_00, And he is still in an academic publishing.
1108.20,1112.20,SPEAKER_00, And other friends just moved to trade publishing after years in academic publishing.
1112.20,1118.20,SPEAKER_00," It feels like maybe she made a compromise, but it's like three times the money is with everything else."
1118.20,1120.20,SPEAKER_00, It's industry and academics.
1120.20,1121.20,SPEAKER_00, Oh.
1121.20,1122.20,SPEAKER_00, It's terrible.
1122.20,1124.20,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, it's amazing."
1124.20,1128.20,SPEAKER_00," And, you know, ages ago I got a card from Liz Ganon."
1128.20,1132.20,SPEAKER_00, I told you this because you showed us her picture.
1132.20,1133.20,SPEAKER_03," Yeah, crazy."
1133.20,1136.20,SPEAKER_00," And I keep thinking maybe I'd get in touch, but I haven't done it."
1136.20,1141.20,SPEAKER_00," And then I saw in the Tufts thing that Ginny Tada is living, you know, in the alumni thing."
1141.20,1146.20,SPEAKER_00, He's living in the San Francisco Bay area with her two daughters and no mention of Clive.
1146.20,1148.20,SPEAKER_00," So, I assume she's working."
1148.20,1151.20,SPEAKER_00," Well, they've been working over a long time."
1151.20,1152.20,SPEAKER_02," Oh, a long time."
1152.20,1153.20,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1153.20,1156.20,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, I've forgotten how long that's been."
1156.20,1157.20,SPEAKER_02, It's been a long time.
1157.20,1158.20,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1158.20,1161.20,SPEAKER_00, And we've lost track of Kelly.
1161.20,1163.20,SPEAKER_02," Uh, Kelly Cameron."
1163.20,1164.20,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1164.20,1165.20,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1165.20,1166.20,SPEAKER_02, I have two.
1166.20,1167.20,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1167.20,1168.20,SPEAKER_00," So, I don't know where he might be."
1168.20,1169.20,SPEAKER_02," He got married, I think."
1169.20,1170.20,SPEAKER_00, I think.
1170.20,1173.20,SPEAKER_00, I think he got married and went to Russia.
1173.20,1175.20,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, I heard, I think I heard that from you."
1175.20,1179.20,SPEAKER_02," And I thought, really, he just gone into a fade."
1179.20,1180.20,SPEAKER_00," Oh, yeah."
1180.20,1182.20,SPEAKER_00, I don't know where he is.
1182.20,1184.20,SPEAKER_00," So, yeah."
1184.20,1188.20,SPEAKER_02," If I, you know, once a while people come up out of the blue, let's see."
1188.20,1190.20,SPEAKER_02, I just probably after your time.
1190.20,1192.20,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, I got to have John Bishop."
1192.20,1195.20,SPEAKER_02," He's just 80, 80, 80, 1, or 80, and 81, 82."
1195.20,1198.20,SPEAKER_02, He's going to show up in about two weeks.
1198.20,1201.20,SPEAKER_02," Suddenly they, suddenly I get an email from somebody, you know."
1201.20,1203.20,SPEAKER_02," Are you, are you, are you, what?"
1203.20,1204.20,SPEAKER_00, You're on email?
1204.20,1205.20,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1205.20,1207.20,SPEAKER_00," Okay, so I should take down your email address."
1207.20,1208.20,SPEAKER_02," Take it, yeah."
1208.20,1209.20,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1209.20,1210.20,SPEAKER_00, Let me get a pen.
1210.20,1212.20,SPEAKER_00," Um, so he just said, he's coming."
1212.20,1217.20,SPEAKER_02," Well, well, he's got this, this email saying, you know, I, are you out there?"
1217.20,1219.20,SPEAKER_02," And I said, yes, I am."
1219.20,1220.20,SPEAKER_02," He said, I'm coming."
1220.20,1221.20,SPEAKER_02, And so we're going to get together in about 10 days or so.
1221.20,1222.20,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, he's a good guy."
1222.20,1223.20,SPEAKER_00, I know.
1223.20,1224.20,SPEAKER_00, Hi.
1224.20,1225.20,SPEAKER_00, All right.

1227.20,1230.20,SPEAKER_00, Who's thinking maybe one or two more summers?
1230.20,1231.20,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1231.20,1233.20,SPEAKER_02," Well, just like, yeah."
1233.20,1235.20,SPEAKER_00, Give me your email.
1235.20,1236.20,SPEAKER_02," All right, Robert."

1275.20,1278.20,SPEAKER_02," And if you write me then, I'll have your address."
1278.20,1279.20,SPEAKER_00, Right.
1279.20,1280.20,SPEAKER_00, Right.
1280.20,1281.20,SPEAKER_00, Cause they have an I-Bother on email.
1281.20,1282.20,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
1282.20,1283.20,SPEAKER_00, Let me go get Sam and give him a turn.
1283.20,1284.20,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1284.20,1285.20,SPEAKER_00, We have to swap baby.
1285.20,1286.20,SPEAKER_00, Right.
1286.20,1287.20,SPEAKER_00, She's always running around.
1287.20,1288.20,SPEAKER_00, Thanks a lot for calling.
1288.20,1289.20,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1289.20,1290.20,SPEAKER_00, Good talking to you.
1290.20,1291.20,SPEAKER_02, Thanks so much.
1291.20,1292.20,SPEAKER_02, I was going to write.
1292.20,1293.20,SPEAKER_02, I was going to write fairly soon.
1293.20,1294.20,SPEAKER_02, It's on the top of the pile.
1294.20,1296.20,SPEAKER_02, But these are crazy days.
1296.20,1300.20,SPEAKER_00," Well, I'm sure until the 22nd you're going to have no free time at all."
1300.20,1301.20,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1301.20,1304.20,SPEAKER_00, That's how come in in September?
1304.20,1305.20,SPEAKER_02," Oh, yeah."
1305.20,1309.20,SPEAKER_02," September, maybe end of August, depending on what, but probably September."
1309.20,1310.20,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1310.20,1312.20,SPEAKER_02," And the numbers are down, unfortunately."
1312.20,1315.20,SPEAKER_02, Things are required in the German world.
1315.20,1316.20,SPEAKER_00, Really?
1316.20,1317.20,SPEAKER_00, How many?
1317.20,1320.20,SPEAKER_02," Well, this winter semester, I think I'm going to have about nine."
1320.20,1321.20,SPEAKER_00, Wow.
1321.20,1323.20,SPEAKER_02, Seven undergraduates and two grads.
1323.20,1327.20,SPEAKER_00, I wonder if that's because the end of the Cold War.
1327.20,1334.20,SPEAKER_02," Uh, nobody seems to know why, but the interest has shifted away from Germany and Russia to Japan and China."
1334.20,1335.20,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1335.20,1338.20,SPEAKER_00," Well, you know, it's very aware of that in San Diego."
1338.20,1342.20,SPEAKER_00, Are there any programs in South America?
1342.20,1347.20,SPEAKER_02," Not from Tufts, because that would compete with our own program in Spain."
1347.20,1350.20,SPEAKER_02, But there are all kinds of programs in South America.
1350.20,1353.20,SPEAKER_02," And of course, Tufts kids go on programs in South America."
1353.20,1355.20,SPEAKER_02, And Australia is very big these days.
1355.20,1356.20,SPEAKER_02, Don't ask me why.
1356.20,1357.20,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1357.20,1358.20,SPEAKER_02, Because they're not in the future.
1358.20,1359.20,SPEAKER_00, Because they're not in the future.
1359.20,1360.20,SPEAKER_00, Because they're not in the future.
1360.20,1361.20,SPEAKER_02, Right.
1361.20,1362.20,SPEAKER_02, They English it's far away.
1362.20,1363.20,SPEAKER_02, And who knows?
1363.20,1364.20,SPEAKER_00, Huh.
1364.20,1367.20,SPEAKER_02," So that's, you know, some concern about these things."
1367.20,1370.20,SPEAKER_02," But last year, England was way, way down."
1370.20,1372.20,SPEAKER_02," And this year, they're up again."
1372.20,1374.20,SPEAKER_02," France fluct- I mean, they're all fluctuating a lot."
1374.20,1377.20,SPEAKER_02," And there's some concern, yeah."
1377.20,1378.20,SPEAKER_00, Hmm.
1378.20,1379.20,SPEAKER_00," Oh, I hope it picks up."
1379.20,1380.20,SPEAKER_00, It's such a good opportunity.
1380.20,1381.20,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1381.20,1382.20,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
1382.20,1383.20,SPEAKER_00, I tell everybody what a great program it was.
1383.20,1388.20,SPEAKER_00," You know, when I interview the students for Tufts, I always try to encourage them to think about Tufts."
1388.20,1389.20,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, I do a lot."
1389.20,1390.20,SPEAKER_02," I mean, I'm not a people you interview today."
1390.20,1391.20,SPEAKER_02, Go to Tufts.
1391.20,1392.20,SPEAKER_02, And do they go other places?
1392.20,1393.20,SPEAKER_00," I interview- oh, okay."
1393.20,1395.20,SPEAKER_00, I don't know what their final decisions are.
1395.20,1396.20,SPEAKER_00, They don't tell me that.
1396.20,1399.20,SPEAKER_00," They just tell me who of the people I interview, they accept."
1399.20,1402.20,SPEAKER_00," And this year, they accepted all the ones I interviewed."
1402.20,1405.20,SPEAKER_00," Boy, I just interviewed such a talented crop this year."
1405.20,1406.20,SPEAKER_02, I know.
1406.20,1407.20,SPEAKER_02," Sort of, sort of, I was ridiculous."
1407.20,1408.20,SPEAKER_02, They were such a thing.
1408.20,1411.20,SPEAKER_00, It was a lot better than anyone I had ever interviewed in California.
1411.20,1412.20,SPEAKER_00, I thought it gave me a lot.
1412.20,1415.20,SPEAKER_00," It made me think, okay, best can go to school here."
1415.20,1418.20,SPEAKER_00, I was being very condescending about her going to school in the Midwest before that.
1418.20,1421.20,SPEAKER_00," But they were just- Oh, no, no, no."
1421.20,1422.20,SPEAKER_02, It's a self-selecting process.
1422.20,1427.20,SPEAKER_02," And the people who applied to places like Tufts, and they applied a whole bunch of other good places."
1427.20,1431.20,SPEAKER_02," And the problem is that they go, you know, some people go to Tufts, but a lot of people go other places."
1431.20,1434.20,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, I think that's going to heal the yield is owed."
1434.20,1439.20,SPEAKER_00," I think for the very best of the four, I did her first choice was not Tufts."
1439.20,1440.20,SPEAKER_00, They're up.
1440.20,1443.20,SPEAKER_00, I think it was somewhere like Carlton.
1443.20,1448.20,SPEAKER_00," For the worst one I interviewed, and she was actually weight-listed."
1448.20,1450.20,SPEAKER_00, Her first choice was Tufts.
1450.20,1454.20,SPEAKER_00," And then the other two, one was interested in Brown as well as Tufts."
1454.20,1457.20,SPEAKER_00," And I don't know about the third, the other guy."
1457.20,1460.20,SPEAKER_00, So they were all really interesting kids.
1460.20,1461.20,SPEAKER_02," No, I get the same."
1461.20,1464.20,SPEAKER_02," I get a lot of very, very good people applied to Tufts."
1464.20,1466.20,SPEAKER_00," Okay, then we run and get to stay in trade."
1466.20,1468.20,SPEAKER_00, Doesn't get annoyed with me that he doesn't get any time.
1468.20,1469.20,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
1469.20,1472.20,SPEAKER_00," But, you know, we may redo this in his name because we could each do it once."
1472.20,1475.20,SPEAKER_00, So you may get another call from us in the non-distance future.
1475.20,1476.20,SPEAKER_00, I'll take great.
1476.20,1478.20,SPEAKER_00, You have to wait for them to register him.
1478.20,1479.20,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
1479.20,1480.20,SPEAKER_00, Great.
1480.20,1481.20,SPEAKER_00, Great.
1481.20,1482.20,SPEAKER_00, Great.
1482.20,1483.20,SPEAKER_02, Thank you.
1483.20,1484.20,, Great.
1484.20,1485.20,, Bye.
1485.20,1486.20,, Bye.
1486.20,1487.20,, Bye.
1487.20,1488.20,, Bye.
1488.20,1489.20,, Bye.
1489.20,1490.20,," Well, yeah."
1490.20,1491.20,," Hey, Sam."
1491.20,1492.20,, You can take a couple of get there.
1492.20,1493.20,, Okay.
1493.20,1500.20,, Hi.
1500.20,1505.20,SPEAKER_01," Hi, Sam."
1505.20,1506.20,SPEAKER_02, How are you?
1506.20,1507.20,SPEAKER_01, Thanks a lot.
1507.20,1508.20,SPEAKER_02, It's quite a gimmick.
1508.20,1509.20,SPEAKER_02, Pretty good.
1509.20,1510.20,SPEAKER_02, Hang it in.
1510.20,1511.20,SPEAKER_01," It's very, very hot here."
1511.20,1515.20,SPEAKER_02," And, so, amazing for these parts."
1515.20,1520.20,SPEAKER_02, So everybody's kind of straining around and suffering around.
1520.20,1526.20,SPEAKER_02," But, yeah, it must be like, you know, it's dicey scott and when it's dicey scott here, it's like the end of the world."
1526.20,1527.20,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1527.20,1528.20,SPEAKER_01," Oh, you doing it."
1528.20,1529.20,SPEAKER_01, What's it?
1529.20,1530.20,SPEAKER_01, I'm tired.
1530.20,1531.20,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1531.20,1532.20,SPEAKER_01, You're a good one.
1532.20,1533.20,SPEAKER_01, You're a good one.
1533.20,1534.20,SPEAKER_01, It's a master.
1534.20,1535.20,SPEAKER_01, Really.
1535.20,1536.20,SPEAKER_01, Had to do committee work.
1536.20,1537.20,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1537.20,1538.20,SPEAKER_01, It's interesting.
1538.20,1542.20,SPEAKER_01," The first year you sort of, you're happy you have a job."
1542.20,1543.20,SPEAKER_01, Stuff goes well.
1543.20,1548.20,SPEAKER_01," Then the second year, you figure out what's wrong and you figure it's not that hard to fix it."
1548.20,1554.20,SPEAKER_01, And I suspect in another year or so I'll be used to the fact that you can't fix it.
1554.20,1555.20,SPEAKER_01," But, yeah."
1555.20,1556.20,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1556.20,1557.20,SPEAKER_01, It's no committee work.
1557.20,1564.20,SPEAKER_02, Takes an enormous amount of time and probably wonder sometimes whether it's all worth it.
1564.20,1573.20,SPEAKER_01," Well, it is, especially when you're doing committees where you're supposed to be doing something but then the administration goes and does something entirely."
1573.20,1576.20,SPEAKER_01, And so you've wasted your time entirely.
1576.20,1577.20,SPEAKER_01," Oh, yeah."
1577.20,1579.20,SPEAKER_01, It's a little frustrating.
1579.20,1584.20,SPEAKER_01, It's not any worth here than anywhere else.
1584.20,1587.20,SPEAKER_01, It's just a shock.
1587.20,1588.20,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1588.20,1604.20,SPEAKER_01," But I have a student who, actually I haven't had him in a class but he's going to go to to Toothing and I guess 96, 97 on a rotary scholarship."
1604.20,1606.20,SPEAKER_01," Oh, good for him."
1606.20,1608.20,SPEAKER_02, Is it a guy or a group?
1608.20,1609.20,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1609.20,1610.20,SPEAKER_02, A guy?
1610.20,1611.20,SPEAKER_01, Yes.
1611.20,1612.20,SPEAKER_01, A guy.
1612.20,1613.20,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1613.20,1614.20,SPEAKER_02, Sorry.
1614.20,1615.20,SPEAKER_02, What's his name?
1615.20,1616.20,SPEAKER_01, Josh Bacon.
1616.20,1618.20,SPEAKER_01," No, Josh Wilbur."
1618.20,1619.20,SPEAKER_01, Josh Wilbur.
1619.20,1620.20,SPEAKER_01, Wilbur.
1620.20,1621.20,SPEAKER_02, W-I-L-B-E-R?
1621.20,1622.20,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1622.20,1623.20,SPEAKER_01, You are.
1623.20,1624.20,SPEAKER_02," Well, you'll be a Wilbur."
1624.20,1625.20,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1625.20,1626.20,SPEAKER_02," Okay, good."
1626.20,1627.16,SPEAKER_01, I'll keep my eyes out for him.
1627.16,1629.16,SPEAKER_01, I'll be till not this act in a cure.
1629.16,1630.16,SPEAKER_01, It would be the fall of 96.
1630.16,1631.16,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1631.16,1632.16,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1632.16,1633.16,SPEAKER_02, That would be a while.
1633.16,1634.16,SPEAKER_02, So he knows already that he's gotten this?
1634.16,1635.16,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1635.16,1641.16,SPEAKER_01," Well, he hasn't got the official letter but he's been selected from the Missouri area."
1641.16,1642.16,SPEAKER_01," So he said, good."
1642.16,1643.16,SPEAKER_01, Good.
1643.16,1644.16,SPEAKER_01, Going.
1644.16,1645.16,SPEAKER_01, Great.
1645.16,1647.16,SPEAKER_01, It's great because he didn't have enough money to go.
1647.16,1654.16,SPEAKER_01, He was thinking he really wanted to go but he was just giving up until after he finished school.
1654.16,1662.16,SPEAKER_01, I was going to go for a trip and I talked him into looking into this because I knew he had a good transcript.
1662.16,1666.16,SPEAKER_01, I figured his competition in this area wouldn't be that tough.
1666.16,1667.16,SPEAKER_02, Uh-huh.
1667.16,1668.16,SPEAKER_02, Good work.
1668.16,1669.16,SPEAKER_02, Great.
1669.16,1670.16,SPEAKER_02, That's marvelous.
1670.16,1671.16,SPEAKER_02, That's good.
1671.16,1672.16,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1672.16,1674.16,SPEAKER_01, It's great when you feel like you can actually accomplish something.
1674.16,1675.16,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1675.16,1676.16,SPEAKER_02, I was a concrete thing.
1676.16,1678.16,SPEAKER_02," You know, you can say, I really, yeah."
1678.16,1681.16,SPEAKER_02, That's one of the nice things about this job really.
1681.16,1682.16,SPEAKER_02," Daisy, be quiet."
1682.16,1683.16,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1683.16,1684.16,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1684.16,1685.16,SPEAKER_02, Daisy's purring like a cat.
1685.16,1686.16,SPEAKER_02, Hmm.
1686.16,1687.16,SPEAKER_02, I see you.
1687.16,1688.16,, Yeah.
1688.16,1689.16,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1689.16,1692.16,SPEAKER_02," Um, you know, it's one of the nice things about this job here."
1692.16,1695.16,SPEAKER_02," You know, you can do things where you really see, you know, things really happen."
1695.16,1701.16,SPEAKER_02," You know, you write a letter, somebody gets into graduate school or, or, or, you know, whatever you do here on the scene."
1701.16,1707.16,SPEAKER_02," I mean, you see sort of, you know, date, date by date, it's like, like building, like, big carpenter, you know."
1707.16,1711.16,SPEAKER_01," Well, you get a really sort of concentrated, you know, good students and I impact."
1711.16,1719.16,SPEAKER_01," You know, kind of stuff they're doing really, really does change their lives and the, and, and the students are immediately aware of it."
1719.16,1720.16,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1720.16,1721.16,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1721.16,1722.16,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1722.16,1725.16,SPEAKER_01, What I end up doing is slow and long time.
1725.16,1726.16,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1726.16,1727.16,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1727.16,1728.16,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1728.16,1729.16,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1729.16,1735.16,SPEAKER_02," The, uh, some vice president from Tufts, show it up here the other day and give a little talk and sort of around time."
1735.16,1737.16,SPEAKER_02," It was quite a nice guy actually had a good, good talk."
1737.16,1749.16,SPEAKER_02," And he, um, he's someone who was teaching, I think, engineering and he's moved to, into this area and this area and now he's sort of moving up the, the, uh, favatungs, uh, wrong."
1749.16,1750.16,SPEAKER_02, No.
1750.16,1751.16,SPEAKER_02, No.
1751.16,1752.16,SPEAKER_02, The administrative stuff.
1752.16,1753.16,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1753.16,1756.16,SPEAKER_02," And, um, you know, I think that one day he'll probably be a college president somewhere."
1756.16,1763.16,SPEAKER_02," I mean, I think that's what sort of, on his mind and, and, and, uh, very, very nice person and really a lot, a lot going for him."
1763.16,1767.16,SPEAKER_02," Different priorities, different things that, that, uh, we're important for him."
1767.16,1774.16,SPEAKER_02," And I think that, that power is a certain extent and maybe, I don't know exactly different kinds of problems."
1774.16,1775.16,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1775.16,1791.16,SPEAKER_02," And, um, maybe, you know, having more of the big picture and stuff where people who are teaching or running a program or everybody gets, uh, tie down as sort of a small little corner and thinks that that corner is kind of the beginning of the end world without end."
1791.16,1792.16,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1792.16,1794.16,SPEAKER_02," And, uh, it's very interesting."
1794.16,1800.16,SPEAKER_02," I, uh, uh, but I'm very, you know, happy doing what I'm doing."
