184.00,185.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
185.00,187.00,SPEAKER_01, What about Rosa?
187.00,189.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, I have to ask Mommy."
189.00,193.00,SPEAKER_01, Because Mom says she wanted to invite Rosa and I'd love for her to invite Rosa.
193.00,194.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
194.00,195.00,SPEAKER_00," Okay, well, I'll ask her."
195.00,196.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
196.00,201.00,SPEAKER_00, And then we need to get an address for your friend Valerie.
201.00,203.00,SPEAKER_01, I've tried to get one.
203.00,206.00,SPEAKER_01, I'll try and do it.
206.00,207.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
207.00,208.00,SPEAKER_01, All right.
208.00,209.00,SPEAKER_01," She was living here, actually in London."
209.00,210.00,SPEAKER_00, I was.
210.00,212.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, so I'll have to."
212.00,214.00,SPEAKER_01, Maybe I'll just call up information here and see.
214.00,215.00,SPEAKER_01, I don't think she's still here though.
215.00,216.00,SPEAKER_01, I think she's in Philadelphia.
216.00,217.00,SPEAKER_01, But I'll find out.
217.00,218.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
218.00,220.00,SPEAKER_00, Did John Rolsen give you a call?
220.00,221.00,SPEAKER_01," Yes, he did."
221.00,222.00,SPEAKER_00, That's nice.
222.00,223.00,SPEAKER_00, That's nice.
223.00,224.00,SPEAKER_00, That's nice.
224.00,225.00,SPEAKER_00, That's nice.
225.00,227.00,SPEAKER_00, I'm looking for your address.
227.00,228.00,SPEAKER_01, Who?
228.00,229.00,SPEAKER_00, Adam Holner.
229.00,230.00,SPEAKER_01, Adam Holner.
230.00,231.00,SPEAKER_01, Adam Holner.
231.00,232.00,SPEAKER_00, Why?
232.00,236.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, Mommy and I were seated with his mother."
236.00,238.00,SPEAKER_00, I'm sure this is why.
238.00,239.00,SPEAKER_00, At least is wedding.
239.00,240.00,SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh.
240.00,242.00,SPEAKER_00," And yeah, we were just talking about you."
242.00,246.00,SPEAKER_00, And she said that she was sure Adam would want to get in touch with you.
246.00,248.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, guess what he does."
248.00,249.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
249.00,251.00,SPEAKER_00," Let me get some nice guy, I know."
251.00,253.00,SPEAKER_01, Does he know that I live all the way here?
253.00,254.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, he does know."
254.00,256.00,SPEAKER_00, That would get you first.
256.00,257.00,SPEAKER_00, That's funny.
257.00,258.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
258.00,265.00,SPEAKER_00, And there are other things I need to tell you.
265.00,267.00,SPEAKER_00, I was talking to Spencer.
267.00,268.00,SPEAKER_00, Uh-huh.
268.00,275.00,SPEAKER_00, And he needs to know whether there will be more than one set up or just one set up.
275.00,279.00,SPEAKER_00," Now, the set up would be everybody being photographed in the same place."
279.00,280.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I know."
280.00,281.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, just one."
281.00,282.00,SPEAKER_00, One.
282.00,285.00,SPEAKER_01, And then he needs to tell him I want black velvet.
285.00,286.00,SPEAKER_00, Huh?
286.00,287.00,SPEAKER_01, I want black velvet.
287.00,288.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
288.00,289.00,SPEAKER_01, Back top.
289.00,291.00,SPEAKER_01," That's it, really."
291.00,292.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
292.00,293.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
293.00,301.00,SPEAKER_00, And then he needs to know how many different shots you anticipate.
301.00,302.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
302.00,305.00,SPEAKER_01, I have to think about that.
305.00,306.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
306.00,307.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
307.00,309.00,SPEAKER_00, I told him how many roles I wanted.
309.00,310.00,SPEAKER_00, Uh-huh.
310.00,313.00,SPEAKER_01, I told him I wanted ten to an encoder.
313.00,314.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
314.00,318.00,SPEAKER_01, But I think it might actually have to be more than ten.
318.00,319.00,, Uh-huh.
319.00,326.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, I mean, obviously, you know, the expenses go up the more he has to shoot."
326.00,328.00,SPEAKER_00, You know what I mean?
328.00,329.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, yeah."
329.00,334.00,SPEAKER_00, Like there's a relationship between the number of roles he shoots and the cost of the hole.
334.00,335.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, yeah."
335.00,336.00,SPEAKER_01," No, I know."
336.00,337.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, yeah, because he has to take it to a place."
337.00,339.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm going to go and contact all of them.
339.00,340.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
340.00,341.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
341.00,342.00,SPEAKER_00, All right.
342.00,343.00,SPEAKER_00, All right.
343.00,344.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, all of it be black and white."
344.00,345.00,SPEAKER_01, Um.
345.00,346.00,, Yes.
346.00,347.00,, Okay.
347.00,348.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
348.00,349.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
349.00,358.00,SPEAKER_01," And if it's not going to cost too much, I'd like to buy one of the roles, whichever role it's the nicest one."
358.00,359.00,SPEAKER_02, Uh-huh.
359.00,360.00,SPEAKER_01, I'd like to buy that role.
360.00,361.00,, Uh-huh.
361.00,362.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
362.00,363.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
363.00,364.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
364.00,365.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
365.00,366.00,, Okay.
366.00,367.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
367.00,368.00,, Okay.
368.00,369.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
369.00,375.00,SPEAKER_00, So you'll have to think about how many different shots there would be like people set up.
375.00,376.00,SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.
376.00,377.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
377.00,378.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
378.00,384.00,SPEAKER_00, And then do you actually want any photograph taken during the ceremony itself?
384.00,386.00,SPEAKER_01, I don't think so.
386.00,387.00,SPEAKER_01, What do you think?
387.00,388.00,SPEAKER_01, I don't get to tackle.
388.00,389.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
389.00,390.00,SPEAKER_00," No, I don't think you need it."
390.00,391.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
391.00,392.00,SPEAKER_00, I'm not going to.
392.00,393.00,SPEAKER_00, Let me know.
393.00,396.00,SPEAKER_01, I think it's just going to be hard enough.
396.00,397.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, right."
397.00,398.00,SPEAKER_00, I don't need that.
398.00,399.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
399.00,400.00,SPEAKER_00," And because of that environment, I don't, I think you're right on that."
400.00,401.00,SPEAKER_00, I think it would be awkward.
401.00,402.00,SPEAKER_00, Mm-hmm.
402.00,406.00,SPEAKER_00," Um, so I think that's better actually."
406.00,412.00,SPEAKER_00," So if you, you know, this way he could just take all the pictures he needs to take actually before the ceremony itself."
412.00,413.00,SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.
413.00,418.00,SPEAKER_01," And what I would like to do, which, you know, we've heard about people doing elsewhere."
418.00,423.00,SPEAKER_01," The color ones during the meal is, you know, put some of those disposable cameras on some tables."
423.00,424.00,SPEAKER_01, You know?
424.00,425.00,SPEAKER_02, Uh-huh.
425.00,428.00,SPEAKER_01," Because I'll, I'll be sure to get pictures of my friends and stuff."
428.00,429.00,SPEAKER_00, Mm-hmm.
429.00,430.00,SPEAKER_00," Damn, that's good."
430.00,431.00,SPEAKER_00, That's good.
431.00,432.00,SPEAKER_00, That's good.
432.00,433.00,SPEAKER_00, What do you think of that?
433.00,434.00,SPEAKER_00," No, that's fine."
434.00,435.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, I think that's fine."
435.00,436.00,SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.
436.00,438.00,SPEAKER_00," Okay, well, I told him I would get back to him."
438.00,439.00,SPEAKER_00, How many rows did you tell him?
439.00,446.00,SPEAKER_01, I told him 10 to 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2.
446.00,447.00,, Mm-hmm.
447.00,448.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
448.00,449.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
449.00,459.00,SPEAKER_00," Well anyway, what you do have to think about is the number of, you know, you know, the number of sort of people poses."
459.00,462.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I want to."
462.00,465.00,SPEAKER_00," Because, you know, he has to a lot."
465.00,469.00,SPEAKER_00, I've met enough time in order to accomplish all of that.
469.00,475.00,SPEAKER_00," It's not as if, and I know what it's like at Drexel, when we have bunches of people getting their pictures taken."
475.00,478.00,SPEAKER_00, It takes a while to get them appropriately set up.
478.00,484.00,SPEAKER_00, You have to take several shots of each grouping of that can take a considerable amount of time.
484.00,487.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
487.00,490.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I'll think about all that."
490.00,491.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, okay."
491.00,495.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I'm also going to have a list of stuff that music if I want the DJ play."
495.00,497.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, okay, well, you know, any time you've..."
497.00,500.00,SPEAKER_00, You can probably let them know that when you come back here.
500.00,509.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, I can call him an ask him, but I think you can probably let them know pretty close to the time itself."
509.00,510.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
510.00,512.00,SPEAKER_00," But anyway, we'll probably doubt about that."
512.00,518.00,SPEAKER_00," I, you know, the invitations have gone out along with all of the information on travel and Philadelphia."
518.00,521.00,SPEAKER_00, I sent a map so people can see how to get to the art alliance.
521.00,522.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, that's nice, Dad."
522.00,525.00,SPEAKER_00, For all the people out from out of town.
525.00,529.00,SPEAKER_00," And then I also sent them information on hotel, the term best at the bar clay."
529.00,530.00,SPEAKER_00," Right, actually."
530.00,533.00,SPEAKER_00, It's actually the best deal because they'll give me the best deal.
533.00,534.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, really?"
534.00,536.00,SPEAKER_01," Hold on, let me get a pen."
536.00,538.00,SPEAKER_01, To write this down.
538.00,539.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
539.00,546.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, the bar clay, which is right across the street, will..."
546.00,547.00,SPEAKER_01," It's right next door, right?"
547.00,550.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, right, the correct, the correct, the street."
550.00,551.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
551.00,556.00,SPEAKER_00," Is, I think it's $99 for a double and $89 for singles."
556.00,558.00,SPEAKER_00," Is that what it is, Alex?"
558.00,559.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
559.00,560.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
560.00,562.00,SPEAKER_00, It's $89 for a single and $99 for a double.
562.00,564.00,SPEAKER_01," Okay, did you check on triples or no?"
564.00,566.00,SPEAKER_00," No, I didn't, but I can do that easily."
566.00,567.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
567.00,571.00,SPEAKER_01," And that's a deal, that's not the regular price."
571.00,572.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, that's not the regular price."
572.00,573.00,SPEAKER_00, Regular price?
573.00,574.00,SPEAKER_00, The regular price is $120.
574.00,575.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
575.00,576.00,SPEAKER_01, So it's taking $20 off?
576.00,578.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, they're taking $20 off."
578.00,579.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
579.00,582.00,SPEAKER_00, And the holiday end is actually the same price.
582.00,583.00,SPEAKER_00, The holiday end.
583.00,584.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, and that's on a yucky."
584.00,593.00,SPEAKER_00, Was $99 for a double without a continental breakfast and $114 with the continental breakfast.
593.00,594.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, that's the two."
594.00,596.00,SPEAKER_01," So at the bar clay, do you get breakfast?"
596.00,597.00,SPEAKER_00, No.
597.00,598.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
598.00,599.00,SPEAKER_00, The room cost is that.
599.00,600.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
600.00,609.00,SPEAKER_00," But I mean, you know it's well-died to, that only if you want to have a relatively inexpensive meal, you walk up to a diner on the square two blocks away."
609.00,610.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
610.00,611.00,SPEAKER_01, Exactly.
611.00,617.00,SPEAKER_00," And so, you know, in that area of town, you can actually eat quite expensive life."
617.00,624.00,SPEAKER_00, Because there are a lot of Asian restaurants that you can walk to within a couple of blocks.
624.00,628.00,SPEAKER_01," And so, you know, it's, it's, no, I mean there's Italian restaurants right around there too."
628.00,629.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
629.00,633.00,SPEAKER_00, I mean there are lots of places where people could eat relatively inexpensively around the bar clay.
633.00,634.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
634.00,636.00,SPEAKER_00, And so that actually turned out to be the best deal.
636.00,637.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
637.00,639.00,SPEAKER_00, That could be arranged.
639.00,646.00,SPEAKER_00," And so I've, you know, sent a written statement to all of the people from out of town, indicating you know what their options are."
646.00,647.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
647.00,648.00,SPEAKER_00, And they all have a map as well.
648.00,649.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
649.00,650.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
650.00,652.00,SPEAKER_00, So all of that is working out quite nicely.
652.00,653.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
653.00,656.00,SPEAKER_01, So it turns out that I think the bed breakfast is cheaper than that.
656.00,657.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
657.00,658.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, I can find out about that."
658.00,659.00,SPEAKER_00, I didn't do that yet.
659.00,660.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
660.00,662.00,SPEAKER_01," Did you, did you, I, did I give you the name of it?"
662.00,663.00,SPEAKER_00, The reserve.
663.00,664.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
664.00,665.00,SPEAKER_00, Law reserve.
665.00,666.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
666.00,667.00,SPEAKER_00," No, I didn't do that one yet."
667.00,668.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
668.00,669.00,SPEAKER_01, But I can do that.
669.00,670.00,SPEAKER_01, What's your note?
670.00,671.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
671.00,672.00,SPEAKER_01, Could you ask about whether they'll do triple there in rooms with a bathroom?
672.00,673.00,SPEAKER_00, Uh huh.
673.00,674.00,, Okay.
674.00,679.00,SPEAKER_01," Because Charlie's mother and grandmothers are going to be, you know, is it all they're not"
679.00,681.00,SPEAKER_00, coming? No.
681.00,682.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
682.00,684.00,SPEAKER_00, You're in the two grandmothers and stuff.
684.00,689.00,SPEAKER_01," Um, no, as uncle's not coming yet, his uncle's going to be watching the grandfather."
689.00,690.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, I see."
690.00,692.00,SPEAKER_01," Um, no, it's the person he works for."
692.00,694.00,SPEAKER_01, It's like a really good family friend.
694.00,696.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, you mean the person Charlie works for?"
696.00,697.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
697.00,698.00,SPEAKER_01, What's the name?
698.00,699.00,SPEAKER_00, Graham.
699.00,700.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, that's what I thought was the uncle's name."
700.00,701.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
701.00,702.00,SPEAKER_00," No, Peter's the uncle."
702.00,703.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
703.00,704.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
704.00,705.00,SPEAKER_00, All right.
705.00,706.00,SPEAKER_00, So that's very nice.
706.00,707.00,SPEAKER_00, Did you send out the invitations that you got?
707.00,708.00,SPEAKER_00," No, not yet."
708.00,709.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
709.00,710.00,SPEAKER_01, No.
710.00,713.00,SPEAKER_01, You want to hear the weirdest thing?
713.00,714.00,SPEAKER_01, Uh huh.
714.00,715.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
715.00,720.00,SPEAKER_01," Today I came out of the British Museum and it's just packed, you know, with tourists, whatever."
720.00,722.00,SPEAKER_01, And lots of Italians.
722.00,736.20,SPEAKER_01," And I went out around the corner and made a call home and as I was standing in the phone booth, there was this group of pretty fairly like mid teenage year kids walking by."
736.20,738.00,SPEAKER_01, One of them was just staring at me.
738.00,740.00,SPEAKER_00, And don't tell me.
740.00,741.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
741.00,743.00,SPEAKER_00, The young woman in the house where you stayed before?
743.00,744.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
744.00,745.00,SPEAKER_00, Oh my god.
745.00,746.00,SPEAKER_01, Isn't that bizarre?
746.00,747.00,SPEAKER_00, And you talked to her?
747.00,748.00,SPEAKER_01, I was staring at her.
748.00,753.00,SPEAKER_01, Then I went out and I couldn't remember where I'd seen her before.
753.00,754.00,SPEAKER_01, Uh huh.
754.00,758.00,SPEAKER_01, And then she was up waiting in front of a bus with all these Italian kids.
758.00,759.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
759.00,760.00,SPEAKER_01, And she was kept staring at me.
760.00,768.00,SPEAKER_01," And then as I got close, she kind of like walked around like behind one of her friends or something like she was nervous or something."
768.00,770.00,SPEAKER_01, I think this is just too weird.
770.00,772.00,SPEAKER_01, And I didn't recognize it as her.
772.00,774.00,SPEAKER_01, And then I walked past the bus.
774.00,777.00,SPEAKER_01, And then I turned around and I just looked at her.
777.00,778.00,SPEAKER_01, And then I just started smiling.
778.00,781.00,SPEAKER_01, And she started smiling and so I kind of know what's around everything.
781.00,783.00,SPEAKER_01," But, I'm not crazy."
783.00,784.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
784.00,785.00,SPEAKER_00, What's her name?
785.00,786.00,SPEAKER_00, Kiara.
786.00,787.00,SPEAKER_01, Kiara.
787.00,788.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
788.00,790.00,SPEAKER_00, She just did it a small world.
790.00,791.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
791.00,793.00,SPEAKER_00, So she was there with some sort of Italian group.
793.00,795.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, it was like a school group or something because it was all kids, you know."
795.00,796.00,SPEAKER_01, Right.
796.00,797.00,SPEAKER_01," 15, 16 years."
797.00,798.00,SPEAKER_01, Right.
798.00,799.00,SPEAKER_00, Visiting the British Museum.
799.00,800.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
800.00,801.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
801.00,802.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
802.00,803.00,SPEAKER_00, Very good.
803.00,804.00,SPEAKER_00, Very good.
804.00,809.00,SPEAKER_00, I also incidentally called the Marriage License Bureau in Philadelphia.
809.00,810.00,SPEAKER_00, Uh huh.
810.00,811.00,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
811.00,820.00,SPEAKER_00," Now, if you're getting married on Saturday the night, the latest date on which you can apply for the license is preceding Monday."
820.00,822.00,SPEAKER_01, Preceding Monday.
822.00,826.00,SPEAKER_00, So it would be the fourth of September.
826.00,828.00,SPEAKER_00, Is that the preceding Monday?
828.00,830.00,SPEAKER_00, Why do we have the Monday before?
830.00,832.00,SPEAKER_01, The Monday is the same week.
832.00,833.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
833.00,834.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, okay."
834.00,835.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
835.00,839.00,SPEAKER_00," But, now the problem is, and I don't know the answer to this, how quickly can-"
839.00,840.00,SPEAKER_01, That's Labor Day.
840.00,843.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, and it's called called it's Labor Day."
843.00,844.00,SPEAKER_01, So it's got to be the week before?
844.00,846.00,SPEAKER_00, So probably you have to do it the Friday before then.
846.00,848.00,SPEAKER_01, You can apply any day of the week.
848.00,850.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah. Okay.
850.00,853.00,SPEAKER_00, I can check on this again to see what happens because of Labor Day.
853.00,854.00,SPEAKER_00, You're absolutely right.
854.00,855.00,SPEAKER_00, I thought that was a-
855.00,861.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, what we were thinking was that he would come when is that that Wednesday about the 26th?"
861.00,862.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
862.00,864.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, of critical importance- Oh, no, no."
864.00,865.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm sorry.
865.00,867.00,SPEAKER_01, The 30th or so.
867.00,868.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
868.00,869.00,SPEAKER_01," Of critical importance, yes."
869.00,877.00,SPEAKER_00, Of critical importance is you're having the blood test completed in the United States in the state of Pennsylvania prior to the application for the marriage license.
877.00,883.00,SPEAKER_00, You have to have the result of the blood test before they will allow you even to apply for the marriage license.
883.00,885.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, how long does that take?"
885.00,886.00,SPEAKER_00, And that's what I have to find out.
886.00,888.00,SPEAKER_00, I suspect it takes at least three days.
888.00,890.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, mom knows."
890.00,891.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, Mary."
891.00,897.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, mommy said she might be done overnight."
897.00,898.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
898.00,904.00,SPEAKER_01, But he's going to have to be here that week before the Labor Day.
904.00,908.00,SPEAKER_01, So we're looking really at the 28th or the 29th for him.
908.00,909.00,SPEAKER_00, Probably.
909.00,910.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
910.00,924.00,SPEAKER_00," But what I'll do is I'll call the doctor's office on Monday just to be sure that they can do a blood test overnight because that way you could have it done on Wednesday, get the result on Thursday and go for marriage license on Friday."
924.00,925.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
925.00,926.00,SPEAKER_01, Hold on a second.
926.00,927.00,SPEAKER_01, We have to have a blood test.
927.00,934.00,SPEAKER_01, We both have to have a blood test in the United States before we even apply for the marriage license and it's gone.
934.00,938.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, but that's a state holiday."
938.00,939.00,SPEAKER_01, So that's that.
939.00,941.00,SPEAKER_01, So we have to have the blood test about three days before that.
941.00,943.00,SPEAKER_01, So you're going to have to come in here.
943.00,946.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm going to have to pick you up in New York and bring you a better good thing.
946.00,948.00,SPEAKER_01, Or New York if you're going to come into New York.
948.00,952.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, in any case, let me find out for sure."
952.00,958.00,SPEAKER_01," Yes, he's a thing is because he can get a cheaper plane ticket on the first."
958.00,959.00,SPEAKER_00, Which is what day of the week.
959.00,961.00,SPEAKER_01, That's a Friday.
961.00,962.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, I see."
962.00,963.00,SPEAKER_00, I don't think that will work.
963.00,969.00,SPEAKER_00," I'll worry because I mean, you're not going to be able to get a blood for any blood worked on over the weekend."
969.00,970.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
970.00,971.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
971.00,974.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm trying to say thanks for finding my health.
974.00,977.00,SPEAKER_00, I'm not going to be able to do that.
977.00,978.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
978.00,983.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, otherwise you will be pledging your vows in full knowing."
983.00,984.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
984.00,994.00,SPEAKER_01," And so, and to take guarantee that when you apply for the marriage license, you'll get it."
994.00,995.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
995.00,998.00,SPEAKER_00," She said if you apply on Monday, you'll have it by Friday."
998.00,999.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
999.00,1001.00,SPEAKER_00, And you just have to have it today before.
1001.00,1002.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
1002.00,1003.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
1003.00,1012.50,SPEAKER_00," But if you were to apply the preceding Friday, which is what I would recommend, especially because of the holiday, then you could probably pick it up on Thursday or so so that you could be less of a hassle."
1012.50,1013.50,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
1013.50,1017.50,SPEAKER_00," So something like that, I think, would work."
1017.50,1022.50,SPEAKER_00," And I said specifically, well, could Charlie and Hillary have the blood worked on in England?"
1022.50,1028.50,SPEAKER_00, And then just bring the results here because I knew you wanted him to come on September 1.
1028.50,1029.50,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1029.50,1031.50,SPEAKER_00," And she said, no, the blood work has to be done in Pennsylvania."
1031.50,1032.50,SPEAKER_01, In Pennsylvania.
1032.50,1039.50,SPEAKER_00," On less, we have a reciprocal agreement with another state in which case we will accept their results."
1039.50,1043.50,SPEAKER_00," But then, you know, I'd have to investigate to find out whether they have a reciprocal agreement in another state."
1043.50,1049.30,SPEAKER_00," And so what difference does it make, you know, because the only other state that would be reasonable is New York State."
1049.30,1052.50,SPEAKER_00, But I think that could just lend to certain kinds of complications.
1052.50,1053.50,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1053.50,1054.50,SPEAKER_00, And I just don't trust these bureaucracy.
1054.50,1055.50,, Yeah.
1055.50,1059.50,SPEAKER_01," No, I mean, I thought if we just got a problem with all of that."
1059.50,1060.50,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1060.50,1061.50,SPEAKER_01," I mean, I got lost right."
1061.50,1062.50,SPEAKER_00, Right.
1062.50,1063.50,SPEAKER_00, Right.
1063.50,1066.50,SPEAKER_00, And so that's something to think about as well.
1066.50,1067.50,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1067.50,1068.50,, Okay.
1068.50,1074.50,SPEAKER_00," I mean, particularly in terms of the flight to Charlie, which is."
1074.50,1075.50,, Okay.
1075.50,1076.50,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
1076.50,1079.50,SPEAKER_00, Very good.
1079.50,1083.50,SPEAKER_00," And so, well, I've been so busy as we're."
1083.50,1084.50,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1084.50,1087.50,SPEAKER_01," How's the president, I see?"
1087.50,1088.50,SPEAKER_00," Well, he's not around yet."
1088.50,1092.50,SPEAKER_00," He's coming in on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday."
1092.50,1093.50,SPEAKER_00, He's full of energy.
1093.50,1098.50,SPEAKER_00," However, he had his, he had well his, you know, two B secretary."
1098.50,1101.50,SPEAKER_00, Call me up yesterday.
1101.50,1102.50,SPEAKER_00, Is his secretary?
1102.50,1104.50,SPEAKER_00," Well, his two B secretary."
1104.50,1105.50,SPEAKER_01," Oh, okay."
1105.50,1108.50,SPEAKER_00, Quite a secretary yet because he's not here officially.
1108.50,1114.50,SPEAKER_00," Call me up on Thursday to say that, you know, he'd like to meet with me this is coming Wednesday."
1114.50,1118.50,SPEAKER_00," We already have at least one or two other meetings already scheduled anyway, but this was on another subject."
1118.50,1121.50,SPEAKER_00, And she said he'd like to meet with you at seven o'clock.
1121.50,1129.50,SPEAKER_00, And I said it's seven o'clock at night because I actually have a thing to do for freshman orientation at seven o'clock at night.
1129.50,1133.50,SPEAKER_00," And she said, no, seven o'clock in the morning."
1133.50,1137.50,SPEAKER_00, So he's just a full of energy.
1137.50,1139.50,SPEAKER_01, I think that's how we go.
1139.50,1140.50,SPEAKER_00," Well, right."
1140.50,1150.50,SPEAKER_00, But what I mean is that he's also the sort of person who probably would not take no for an answer.
1150.50,1156.50,SPEAKER_00," Like, you know, you couldn't say, I'm sorry, but seven o'clock is a little in the fourth."
1156.50,1157.50,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1157.50,1162.50,SPEAKER_00," Poor dad's got to get up somewhere like, well, no, I do that anyway."
1162.50,1164.50,SPEAKER_00," I mean, this is kind of a chore for me."
1164.50,1166.50,SPEAKER_01, I see found a house in this area.
1166.50,1167.50,SPEAKER_01, Are you getting breathful in sales?
1167.50,1169.50,SPEAKER_00," Well, no, he's definitely getting breathful in sales."
1169.50,1171.50,SPEAKER_00, Rick House is up to sale.
1171.50,1172.50,SPEAKER_01, Oh.
1172.50,1176.50,SPEAKER_00," And Rick, in fact, I was talking to Rick just yesterday who sends you his regards incidentally."
1176.50,1184.50,SPEAKER_00," And, you know, still remembers the day we were all together in New York to see those two"
1184.50,1185.50,SPEAKER_02, plays.
1185.50,1192.50,SPEAKER_00, And he was settling on a house in St. Louis yesterday. He had called.
1192.50,1196.50,SPEAKER_00," He had very laid on Wednesday night around 11, 15 or 11, 30."
1196.50,1197.50,SPEAKER_00, Got Alex on the phone.
1197.50,1199.50,SPEAKER_00, I was already asleep.
1199.50,1202.50,SPEAKER_00, And so he asked her to have me called him yesterday.
1202.50,1209.50,SPEAKER_00, And it turns out that he was talking to the president of the University of San Diego the day before.
1209.50,1216.50,SPEAKER_00, And told her about me and she then actually encouraged him to have me send in my application.
1216.50,1219.50,SPEAKER_00, For the position I was telling you about right now.
1219.50,1221.50,SPEAKER_00, So I sent it off this morning.
1221.50,1222.50,SPEAKER_01, Wow.
1222.50,1224.50,SPEAKER_00, So we'll see where that someone goes.
1224.50,1225.50,SPEAKER_00, Because anywhere.
1225.50,1226.50,SPEAKER_01," Well, that's great."
1226.50,1227.50,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1227.50,1228.50,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1228.50,1230.50,SPEAKER_00," So he's really, you know, sort of promoting my interest."
1230.50,1235.50,SPEAKER_00," And, and he seemed really quite happy with his new position."
1235.50,1239.50,SPEAKER_00," And he seemed, you know, enthusiastic about it."
1239.50,1242.50,SPEAKER_00, And so that's good.
1242.50,1246.50,SPEAKER_00," And so he's, you know, settling in rather well."
1246.50,1247.50,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1247.50,1250.50,SPEAKER_01," Well, that's good."
1250.50,1252.50,SPEAKER_01, How is this trip to Paris?
1252.50,1253.50,SPEAKER_01," Oh, he loved it."
1253.50,1256.50,SPEAKER_00," Oh, and he especially loved London."
1256.50,1257.50,SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.
1257.50,1259.50,SPEAKER_00," Actually, he liked London more than anything else."
1259.50,1260.50,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1260.50,1261.50,SPEAKER_00, He liked London more than Paris.
1261.50,1262.50,SPEAKER_01, Happy to hear.
1262.50,1263.50,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1263.50,1266.50,SPEAKER_00," So he would, you know, be very happily settled in London forever."
1266.50,1267.50,SPEAKER_02, Oh.
1267.50,1274.50,SPEAKER_02," So he was, you know, he was very pleased."
1274.50,1275.50,SPEAKER_00, Uh-huh.
1275.50,1276.50,SPEAKER_00, Did you do living there?
1276.50,1280.50,SPEAKER_00, He was pleased for us as well as for you since we'd have a nice place to visit from his point of view.
1280.50,1281.50,SPEAKER_00, Mm-hmm.
1281.50,1282.50,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1282.50,1284.50,SPEAKER_01, It is a nice day.
1284.50,1285.50,SPEAKER_00, It really is.
1285.50,1286.50,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1286.50,1288.50,SPEAKER_01, The pollution's kind of bad though.
1288.50,1293.50,SPEAKER_00," Well, mommy and I, you know, we're talking about, you know, Charlie's family and what they want to see in Philadelphia."
1293.50,1298.50,SPEAKER_00," He's a little funny to be saying to people, you must be, you know, colonial area in Philadelphia."
1298.50,1306.50,SPEAKER_00," It dates from the 17th or 18th century when it's full of their lives, but it's the date from the 12th century."
1306.50,1307.50,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1307.50,1308.50,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1308.50,1309.50,SPEAKER_01, That was funny.
1309.50,1311.50,SPEAKER_01, We went to a bar with his parents.
1311.50,1312.50,SPEAKER_01, I don't know.
1312.50,1313.50,SPEAKER_01, It's actually pretty soon after I came here.
1313.50,1314.50,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1314.50,1316.50,SPEAKER_01, And it was right near this really old castle.
1316.50,1317.50,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1317.50,1318.50,SPEAKER_01," What was that, Charlie?"
1318.50,1323.50,SPEAKER_01," It was like, remember, went to that bar down there Tower Bridge and there was that castle thing."
1323.50,1325.50,SPEAKER_01," The red, like, the, just the remains."
1325.50,1326.50,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1326.50,1327.50,SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh.
1327.50,1329.50,SPEAKER_01, And it was from like 11.50 or 12.
1329.50,1330.50,SPEAKER_01," I mean, it was ridiculous."
1330.50,1333.50,SPEAKER_01," That was like, I was just like, you know, just so crazy."
1333.50,1338.50,SPEAKER_01," And then, you know, we're just walking by on the way to this bar, you know, that they wanted to go to."
1338.50,1339.50,SPEAKER_01, Right.
1339.50,1340.50,SPEAKER_00, Right.
1340.50,1341.50,SPEAKER_00, Right.
1341.50,1342.50,SPEAKER_00, Right.
1342.50,1343.50,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
1343.50,1344.50,SPEAKER_00, So how was little Jerome?
1344.50,1345.50,SPEAKER_00," Oh, he's fine."
1345.50,1350.50,SPEAKER_01," He's, um, he seems kind of despondent."
1350.50,1351.50,SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh.
1351.50,1354.50,SPEAKER_01, Angela was never really despondent.
1354.50,1360.50,SPEAKER_00," Well, you know, getting taken up, you know, really capable of manifesting very much by way of emotion."
1360.50,1365.50,SPEAKER_01," But I mean, he doesn't squeak or that much or run around."
1365.50,1366.50,SPEAKER_00, Run around.
1366.50,1367.50,SPEAKER_00," He's a mild, isn't he?"
1367.50,1370.50,SPEAKER_00," I mean, Angela was much more animated than mild."
1370.50,1371.50,SPEAKER_01, Mm.
1371.50,1376.50,SPEAKER_00," Alex, um, has gotten a $2 raise."
1376.50,1377.50,SPEAKER_01, An hour.
1377.50,1378.50,SPEAKER_00, In her draw.
1378.50,1379.50,SPEAKER_01," Oh, my goodness."
1379.50,1380.50,SPEAKER_01, That's a big raise.
1380.50,1381.50,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1381.50,1385.50,SPEAKER_00, And she was told yesterday how well she is doing.
1385.50,1386.50,SPEAKER_01," Oh, that's good."
1386.50,1389.50,SPEAKER_00, Becky's major concern with Alex.
1389.50,1398.50,SPEAKER_00," Might, uh, might leave."
1398.50,1399.50,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1399.50,1400.50,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1400.50,1402.50,SPEAKER_00," Let's, let's change the subject."
1402.50,1403.50,SPEAKER_00, Oh.
1403.50,1404.50,SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh.
1404.50,1405.50,SPEAKER_00, Uh-huh.
1405.50,1409.50,SPEAKER_01," What, you're not allowed to tell me, is that what's going on?"
1409.50,1410.50,SPEAKER_00," No, no, no, no."
1410.50,1416.50,SPEAKER_00," Think of what's happening in our overall conversation, which is being recorded."
1416.50,1417.50,SPEAKER_00, Oh!
1417.50,1418.50,SPEAKER_02, Oh!
1418.50,1419.50,SPEAKER_02, Oh!
1419.50,1420.50,SPEAKER_00," Oh, yeah."
1420.50,1421.50,SPEAKER_00," Oh, oh."
1421.50,1422.50,SPEAKER_00," Oh, oh."
1422.50,1424.50,SPEAKER_00, The light dawn.
1424.50,1427.50,SPEAKER_00," Oh, oh, oh."
1427.50,1432.50,SPEAKER_00," But anyway, Alex, it's very happy to have her increase funds."
1432.50,1439.50,SPEAKER_00," And she had a dream in which she is renting the ideal house in Manningham, Guy."
1439.50,1440.50,SPEAKER_00," Oh, my God."
1440.50,1442.50,SPEAKER_00," The hardwood floors, et cetera, et cetera."
1442.50,1450.50,SPEAKER_00, And then she had checked the newspaper today and it turns out it's very hard to come to buy that ideal house that it probably should be full of.
1450.50,1451.50,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1451.50,1452.50,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1452.50,1453.50,, Yeah.
1453.50,1454.50,SPEAKER_01," In many, okay."
1454.50,1455.50,SPEAKER_00, Right.
1455.50,1457.50,SPEAKER_01, I'm dreaming with Manningham.
1457.50,1462.50,SPEAKER_01, I wish I had dreamed of my life would be simpler.
1462.50,1463.50,SPEAKER_00, Right.
1463.50,1464.50,SPEAKER_00, Right.
1464.50,1465.50,SPEAKER_00, Right.
1465.50,1467.50,SPEAKER_00, So I was Charlie doing all right.
1467.50,1468.50,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1468.50,1469.50,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1469.50,1471.50,SPEAKER_01, I feel bad he was working today again.
1471.50,1472.50,SPEAKER_01, Oh.
1472.50,1474.50,SPEAKER_01, He's working six days a week now.
1474.50,1475.50,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1475.50,1480.50,SPEAKER_01," But, you know, he's a good egg."
1480.50,1482.50,SPEAKER_00," Terrible good egg, yeah."
1482.50,1487.50,SPEAKER_00," And so did you pass on to his mother's information that you had on the hotel, et cetera?"
1487.50,1488.50,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I did."
1488.50,1489.50,SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.
1489.50,1492.50,SPEAKER_00, And I think they're likely just to take the package that's offered.
1492.50,1495.50,SPEAKER_01, I don't think so actually.
1495.50,1500.50,SPEAKER_01," I think there, I mean his mother was leaning towards the grammar scene like when I talked all about them."
1500.50,1501.50,SPEAKER_02, Uh-huh.
1501.50,1505.50,SPEAKER_01," And, but she has to talk to Graham because Graham's going to be getting singles."
1505.50,1506.50,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1506.50,1507.50,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1507.50,1508.50,SPEAKER_01," You know, so it's kind of."
1508.50,1509.50,SPEAKER_01, Right.
1509.50,1511.50,SPEAKER_01, It depends on what he's willing to do.
1511.50,1512.50,SPEAKER_01, Right.
1512.50,1513.50,SPEAKER_01, Why not willing to do so.
1513.50,1515.50,SPEAKER_01," But yeah, the thanks for doing that."
1515.50,1516.50,SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh.
1516.50,1518.50,SPEAKER_01," It's been really, uh, helpful."
1518.50,1519.50,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1519.50,1520.50,SPEAKER_00, Good.
1520.50,1521.50,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1521.50,1525.50,SPEAKER_01," Last night we went to see, um, went in Marcellus."
1525.50,1526.50,SPEAKER_01, Oh really?
1526.50,1527.50,SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh.
1527.50,1529.50,SPEAKER_01," And, um, like, consider jazz orchestra."
1529.50,1530.50,SPEAKER_02, Right.
1530.50,1531.50,SPEAKER_01, The Royal Festival Hall.
1531.50,1532.50,SPEAKER_01, That was really nice.
1532.50,1533.50,SPEAKER_02, Uh-huh.
1533.50,1535.50,SPEAKER_01," And, um, yeah."
1535.50,1536.50,SPEAKER_01, So exciting.
1536.50,1537.50,SPEAKER_00, Uh-huh.
1537.50,1540.50,SPEAKER_00," Well, I'm glad you're making a lot of progress too on the thesis."
1540.50,1542.50,SPEAKER_01, I'm making incredible progress.
1542.50,1548.50,SPEAKER_01," It's, it's just the resources they have here are just amazing."
1548.50,1554.50,SPEAKER_01, I'm finding English translations of things that I couldn't find the original to in New York.
1554.50,1555.50,SPEAKER_00, Uh-huh.
1555.50,1557.50,SPEAKER_01," You know, I mean, it's just crazy."
1557.50,1558.50,SPEAKER_01," So, um."
1558.50,1560.50,SPEAKER_00," Well, that makes life a little bit easier."
1560.50,1561.50,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1561.50,1562.50,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1562.50,1563.50,SPEAKER_01, It does.
1563.50,1566.50,SPEAKER_01," And, um, you know, the publishers are often like these, you know."
1566.50,1571.50,SPEAKER_01, Yesterday I was looking at the English translation of something from 1919.
1571.50,1575.50,SPEAKER_01," Um, and it was, there was only 310 copies made."
1575.50,1577.50,SPEAKER_01," So, obviously, I couldn't find it in New York."
1577.50,1581.50,SPEAKER_01," But, you know, the British Library has a copy of everything written in English."
1581.50,1582.50,SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh.
1582.50,1586.50,SPEAKER_01," And that happens to, you know, include a lot of really bad translations."
1586.50,1587.50,SPEAKER_01, Right.
1587.50,1590.50,SPEAKER_01," So, original, what the hell, I had earlier, 20th century."
1590.50,1591.50,SPEAKER_01, That's right.
1591.50,1593.50,SPEAKER_01," So, um, that's really exciting."
1593.50,1599.50,SPEAKER_01," And, uh, I'm making a lot of connections, which is good."
1599.50,1609.50,SPEAKER_01," And, um, like, really clear-cut evidence, you know, of things, which is, you know, before it had just kind of been vague."
1609.50,1616.50,SPEAKER_01," But now, you know, I know that our Daniel saw Fauci owned, you know, we're so paintings"
1616.50,1623.50,SPEAKER_00," and that, you know. I mean, are you actually doing any original writing?"
1623.50,1624.50,SPEAKER_01, No.
1624.50,1625.50,SPEAKER_00, Uh-huh.
1625.50,1626.50,SPEAKER_00, Ha-ha.
1626.50,1627.50,SPEAKER_01, Ha-ha.
1627.50,1628.50,, Ha-ha.
1628.50,1629.50,, Ha-ha.
1629.50,1630.50,, Ha-ha.
1630.50,1633.50,SPEAKER_00," Well, that's usually what brings on, you know, the..."
1633.50,1634.50,SPEAKER_00," Come on, Grant."
1634.50,1636.50,SPEAKER_00, ...the...the...the...the...an...right.
1636.50,1637.50,SPEAKER_00, Ha-ha.
1637.50,1638.50,SPEAKER_00, Ha-ha.
1638.50,1639.50,SPEAKER_00, Ha-ha.
1639.50,1640.50,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
1640.50,1642.50,SPEAKER_00," Listen, what is your date of return in..."
1642.50,1643.50,SPEAKER_01, 23rd?
1643.50,1644.50,SPEAKER_00, 23rd.
1644.50,1645.50,SPEAKER_01," Mommy, I..."
1645.50,1646.50,SPEAKER_01, Did I get in the 24th?
1646.50,1648.50,SPEAKER_00," Oh, you were robbed here on the 20th?"
1648.50,1649.50,SPEAKER_00," No, no, no, no."
1649.50,1650.50,SPEAKER_01, It's the same date of 23rd.
1650.50,1652.50,SPEAKER_00," Okay, so you arrive on the 23rd?"
1652.50,1653.50,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1653.50,1655.50,SPEAKER_00," Okay, we'll have to know more particulars about that."
1655.50,1658.50,SPEAKER_00, Because Mommy and I will not be here then.
1658.50,1660.50,SPEAKER_01," Oh, where will you be?"
1660.50,1661.50,SPEAKER_00, We will be in Mexico.
1661.50,1663.50,SPEAKER_01," Oh, until when?"
1663.50,1665.50,SPEAKER_00, I think the 23rd.
1665.50,1666.50,SPEAKER_01, Oh.
1666.50,1669.50,SPEAKER_00, But Mark Deena will be here to greet you.
1669.50,1670.50,SPEAKER_01, Ha-ha.
1670.50,1671.50,SPEAKER_00," Well, that..."
1671.50,1672.50,SPEAKER_00, Ha-ha.
1672.50,1677.50,SPEAKER_01, I will just be so chipper after I get off that Lainte flight with the two hour later.
1677.50,1678.50,SPEAKER_01, That's right.
1678.50,1679.50,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1679.50,1681.50,SPEAKER_01, I'll be primed for meeting.
1681.50,1682.50,SPEAKER_01, I'm not meeting.
1682.50,1685.50,SPEAKER_01," Actually, I'm not looking forward to that."
1685.50,1688.50,SPEAKER_01, I'm not going to do that again.
1688.50,1689.50,SPEAKER_01, It was too much.
1689.50,1691.50,SPEAKER_00, It was really better though doing it in the daytime.
1691.50,1692.50,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, yeah, it's probably..."
1692.50,1695.50,SPEAKER_01, It'll be much better doing it in the daytime.
1695.50,1696.50,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1696.50,1697.50,SPEAKER_01," But the other way, it was just..."
1697.50,1702.50,SPEAKER_01, Because just when you get into the flight and you're kind of...
1702.50,1708.50,SPEAKER_01, You're kind of resigned to the fact that you are stuck in the plane for a long period of time.
1708.50,1710.50,SPEAKER_01, You stop and you get off.
1710.50,1711.50,SPEAKER_02, Right.
1711.50,1712.50,SPEAKER_02, Right.
1712.50,1713.50,SPEAKER_02, Right.
1713.50,1716.50,SPEAKER_01," And the ice on the airport is right, actually."
1716.50,1717.50,SPEAKER_01, I'm using.
1717.50,1718.50,SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh.
1718.50,1719.50,SPEAKER_00, It's a five gate.
1719.50,1720.50,SPEAKER_00, Right.
1720.50,1721.50,SPEAKER_00, Right.
1721.50,1724.50,SPEAKER_00," When you do it, did you expect any work you've actually had one second?"
1724.50,1727.50,SPEAKER_01, And it's one long hallway with nothing to buy.
1727.50,1729.50,SPEAKER_01, Nothing to look at.
