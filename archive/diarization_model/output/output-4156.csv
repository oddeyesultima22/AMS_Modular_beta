4.00,5.00,SPEAKER_01, Yes.
5.00,6.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
6.00,10.00,SPEAKER_01," No, they sent us things to my office at Yes, and, you know, it flew."
10.00,12.00,SPEAKER_01, And you get paid $10.
12.00,14.00,SPEAKER_01, I get a free half-an-hour phone call at maximum.
14.00,15.00,SPEAKER_01," You know, you can do less."
15.00,17.00,SPEAKER_01, And I get paid $10 for it.
17.00,19.00,SPEAKER_01," So, wow, that's a great deal."
19.00,20.00,SPEAKER_01, I know.
20.00,25.00,SPEAKER_01," But I got you St. Louis, the center of the earth, the center of the United States of America."
25.00,28.00,SPEAKER_01, You guys should do weird things up there.
28.00,29.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, it's not from there."
29.00,30.00,SPEAKER_01, It's in the University of Pennsylvania.
30.00,32.00,SPEAKER_01, I don't know how they got our address.
32.00,35.00,SPEAKER_01," But anyway, they're not going to use any kind of personal information or anything like that."
35.00,36.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, that's interesting."
36.00,37.00,SPEAKER_01," Plus, they don't know it."
37.00,39.00,SPEAKER_01, You know how like you're being recorded.
39.00,40.00,SPEAKER_01, I know.
40.00,41.00,SPEAKER_01, I know.
41.00,42.00,SPEAKER_01," So, how are you?"
42.00,44.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, why would your phone disconnect?"
44.00,46.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, because I didn't have any money to pay my phone bill."
46.00,52.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm besides the fact that I didn't open up my mail to see that I had received a disconnect notice.
52.00,53.00,SPEAKER_01, Oh.
53.00,54.00,SPEAKER_01," I just like, oh, it's another phone bill."
54.00,57.00,SPEAKER_01," You know, because on my business line, I've gone like two months."
57.00,58.00,SPEAKER_01, Without pain.
58.00,61.00,SPEAKER_01, And they don't disconnect my phone.
61.00,65.00,SPEAKER_01," But I guess because it's residential, it's a different story."
65.00,66.00,SPEAKER_01, Oh.
66.00,69.00,SPEAKER_01," So, my phone got disconnected on Monday."
69.00,74.00,SPEAKER_01," And when I got home, it was already too late to go to the phone place."
74.00,75.00,SPEAKER_01, It was like six.
75.00,79.00,SPEAKER_01, It was about a quarter to six when I had noticed that I got disconnected.
79.00,85.00,SPEAKER_01," So, I jumped in my car and ran back downtown and the business hours had already been closed."
85.00,88.00,SPEAKER_01," So, I paid the next day and they turned it all right away."
88.00,90.00,SPEAKER_01, But it was kind of embarrassing.
90.00,92.00,SPEAKER_01, I was depressed all that night.
92.00,93.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, I can imagine."
93.00,96.00,SPEAKER_01, But it was kind of nice that the phone didn't ring.
96.00,97.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
97.00,98.00,SPEAKER_01, You know.
98.00,100.00,SPEAKER_01, I thought maybe you decided to move back to your parents home.
100.00,101.00,SPEAKER_01," Hey, no."
101.00,102.00,SPEAKER_01, I'll never do that.
102.00,103.00,SPEAKER_01, I'll never move back home.
103.00,104.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, yeah."
104.00,106.00,SPEAKER_01," Rachel, it is so nice without them."
106.00,107.00,SPEAKER_01," Man, I love my parents."
107.00,108.00,SPEAKER_01, I love my parents.
108.00,112.00,SPEAKER_01," I love my parents and everything, but it is so nice to have my own place."
112.00,113.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
113.00,114.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, God."
114.00,116.00,SPEAKER_01, I feel crazy and make sure I'm feeling free to feel free to calculate your own way.
116.00,118.00,SPEAKER_01, And they feel the same about having you out.
118.00,119.00,SPEAKER_01," I don't know, maybe."
119.00,125.00,SPEAKER_01, I know that I have less stress now because I don't have to hear my parents begreen and stuff like that.
125.00,126.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, that's true."
126.00,128.00,SPEAKER_01, Because they do fight.
128.00,132.00,SPEAKER_01," Not fight, but they argue and, you know, there are a couple."
132.00,134.00,SPEAKER_01," I never thought of this before, huh?"
134.00,138.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, yeah, but I guess I just didn't have enough gumption."
138.00,139.00,SPEAKER_01, You know.
139.00,140.00,SPEAKER_01, You don't have enough money.
140.00,141.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, I don't either."
141.00,154.44,SPEAKER_01," My mom said, I'll use. Beautiful. Oh yeah. I tally them up at the end probably when I sell my business and I'll end up with one penny. Oh my boy. But I have to hide in how is New Orleans?"
154.44,196.76,SPEAKER_01," Oh it was great, Angelique. Yeah. We have loved it because oh it was just great. I mean there are a party in the street. Every single I wouldn't want to be there for Mardi Gras or for the jazz festival. Be too darn crowded because there were tons of people in the street every single night. Really? How exciting. Especially on Bourbon Street and there's so many eclectic type people. Yeah. My favorite. You would have loved it. There's just these wild wild, a lot of m- Well I shouldn't really say that but there's just a big mixture of a lot of creole people. Yeah. Oh great. That's just what I need. You know I have to get out of this black man mode. Oh you know what? I just met the cutest black man today and he is hot. Let me tell you. Oh great."
196.76,201.88,SPEAKER_01, I told you. You're gonna get jungle fever and then this Nigerian-est are this Kenyan-est?
201.88,205.88,SPEAKER_01, Me out the other day. You're kidding from Kenya? From Kenya but he's younger than me.
205.88,210.28,SPEAKER_01, They love me? He's really intelligent though. Where's he from? You know I don't really remember.
210.28,226.20,SPEAKER_01," And they have those great accents. God you buy it. So well though, Angelique and he's reading the complete works of Shakespeare and he's read most of the classics. I am really impressed with his intelligence. Oh I would be enthralled myself. But he's only 23 years old. So what?"
227.00,264.20,SPEAKER_01, And so did he ask that on date? Yeah. Well kind of yeah he asked me out for the weekend and I said well if you can find my phone number you can ask me out. Well he's okay hands. He's his teeth bother me a little bit. They're not real. I mean they're straight but there's a little bit of spacing in between it and you know how picky I am about things. But will but I enjoy being with him and talking to him. Hey so how was Haines? Oh Haines was just great like he would have loved him. He's the best. He calls me all the time. Why can't he call him? Why doesn't he call me? I'll tell him to call you. In fact I will tell him to call you. Yeah yeah yeah yeah tell him to call me.
264.20,277.80,SPEAKER_01, Hey I wanted to make it out there but I just couldn't. I've been so busted. And when you can tell up my phone got disconnected. I know. Great. And I'm having a business meeting right now. This girl's supposed to commute me at 5 30 at my house and we're going to discuss them.
278.52,297.56,SPEAKER_01, Perhaps some future venture together. But because I need to generate some money and it's just not happening you know where I'm at even though we had a busy day today. But there's just not enough money. I want more money. I know. And how and your schooling are you almost done with that?
297.56,304.60,SPEAKER_01, I'm thinking to go have everybody has a master's out here. Oh yeah. Well it seems like it.
304.68,330.20,SPEAKER_01, Well I'm going to have mine in two more classes. You're kidding. No I'm not. Oh that's take my exam. You know you can teach it to the junior college then and get kind of what I would like to do. Heck yeah. Come out here and get my PhD. Come out here and cook California. It's just a I don't know it's so comfortable where I am in an exact same-ger zone. That is so dangerous.
330.20,360.04,SPEAKER_01, That comfort zone will get you all the time. Leaky listen I flew in a four-seater plane. Oh I went to the lake of the Ozarks on fourth of July weekend. Yeah. Matt this guy. He's a total Yahoo but let me tell you. I there was something about him. He's in his 40s. But there was something about him. I was attracted to him. It was his plane dammit. He's a police officer. Oh gross.
360.20,382.84,SPEAKER_01, And he's he's never been married that I know. But you know gross I like men in uniform. But this guy he I don't know. I found myself just being drawn toward him. Where did you meet him on the at the thuring this weekend he was there with us. Well we oh in New Orleans he was my friend's friend. No this is at the Lake of the Ozarks on fourth of July weekend. Uh huh. And I just really I don't know.
382.84,388.60,SPEAKER_01, And then I find out my cousin calls and tells me he really liked you. Oh we're gonna play.
388.76,405.48,SPEAKER_01, Listen we're gonna fly over St. Louis. He's gonna take me for a ride in this plane. I both don't know I'm attracted to him. It could be his sessna that we were in. Oh my god. No it's not that kind of a plane at the small four-seater. So I have no men. What happened to the one you were going out with?
405.48,411.24,SPEAKER_01, Randy. Yeah. He went moved to Texas. Oh well that end would have stopped to that one. I don't know.
411.24,416.04,SPEAKER_00, And then he's coming back in September but going to UCLA to start his masters.
416.76,423.96,SPEAKER_01, And then and check this out. Okay he's doing the Masters in Public Health. Uh huh. 12 black people got
423.96,436.28,SPEAKER_00," accepted to the School of Public Health in September of 95 at UCLA. Uh huh. Two of them were black men. Out of the 12 black people, two were black men. And those two black men are"
436.76,456.36,SPEAKER_01," done. Done. John Free and Randy. Oh my goodness. Can you and Matt Rachel is that like a needle in a haystack? UCLA, I meet two black guys in my jungle fever mode and they're both in the same masters department."
457.00,465.16,SPEAKER_01, September 95. But their friends aren't they? No. No. I met Randy. I met Randy on my own.
465.24,495.00,SPEAKER_01, I met him February 24th on my birthday went to Bombay as in parties and I saw this black guy and we started talking and that's it. Oh my god that is totally ironic. And they work in the same field with mentally disabled people. Oh my. Is that weird or what? That is totally wild except Randy's nicer than John Free. I'm sorry but it's just too darn funny that you're telling me to quit that jungle fever and then you go head over heels and do it. Because I'm just getting out of it.
495.00,499.80,SPEAKER_01," I just talked to Joffrey and I before last and were friends. No, yeah. No, yeah."
499.80,509.56,SPEAKER_01, No more nothing less because remember I gave him the boot. Yeah I remember. Well first he wrote me the letter and then we got back together and then he started to become real intimate with me and
509.56,523.32,SPEAKER_00," I got scared and I cut him off. Yeah. And I hadn't talked to him for two and a half months. And so now our god if they record this message, I'll be talking about our dude. Give me a break."
523.96,528.20,SPEAKER_01, Say don't know who the heck you are. Well it's enmeshed with education at the same time.
528.84,534.04,SPEAKER_01, Anyways that's right. We're just murdering higher levels playing.
534.04,554.20,SPEAKER_01, Hey I want to go I want to do my masters. Well you know what I really like taking classes and everything but sometimes like I just had to do the summary this one. You know the scholarly journals and stuff. They talk so high and mighty and stuff and you have to decipher what the heck they're saying to understand what the whole concept is for a while. That kind of bugs me.
554.20,559.88,SPEAKER_01, I just like reading the books and discussing it and that's that. Oh I hate writing about shit too.
559.88,570.76,SPEAKER_00, But that's the work. I mean that's the whole gist of a message is you write your way through through the courses right? I can't believe you've done this without a personal computer.
570.84,586.68,SPEAKER_01, Oh I have one at work. I need to use one at work. Now I use it. You take me hours to write things leaky. Now I mean I guess because one I've been practicing more. Yeah. Using it more. I mean constantly I'm writing and two because of the computer also. I can whip things up so quickly.
586.68,592.36,SPEAKER_00, Yeah. You can't even believe it. That's cool. That's cool to know though. Yeah. You think that I could
593.24,605.16,SPEAKER_01, super hard my writing abilities too. Oh my god if I can leaky anybody can. I'm so insecure about my writing ability. Oh you and me both. I wouldn't even want to show people my writing. Meaning?
605.16,620.52,SPEAKER_01, Because you need like someone to look it over to you know. Proofread it? Yeah. You can't really proofread your own too. At least I can't because I know what I'm trying to say and I overlook all the errors. Yeah. But I would be very embarrassed showing people but now I've gotten more self-confident.
620.52,642.28,SPEAKER_01, I don't like my writing but still. That's what I think. And I never liked my writing either but I let my friends read it and stuff and they dig my writing. I think you have I think you have great thoughts and it comes out well. You do. I don't think so. And as a matter of fact I think you are the one that told me that I write well. I think I write terrible. Oh I think you do. I don't like it.
643.08,684.44,SPEAKER_01," You're into like this very I admire your intellect. Really? Yeah. Thank you. Right. Hey, why don't we get a fine man? We're starting to hold you. I know what though. I'm totally happy to where I am. But you know what? You get out there. You meet all kinds of dudes. I don't know how you do it. But I don't have that ability. You do. I don't know. I just attract the total dorks. I attract the ones with no job with the total bad boy mentality. I must admit that you're a village and the streets smarts maybe of a thousand. But that's about it. That's true. I don't meet any viable men."
685.16,696.60,SPEAKER_01, I don't know why you attract that type. I don't know either. Maybe perhaps because of my low self esteem. Well you have to go back. How's your exercise coming along? Oh I'm supposed to go to
696.60,701.88,SPEAKER_00, water a robo except 530 today but I have that meaning with that girl in the 3535 and she's not here yet.
702.52,719.88,SPEAKER_01," Maybe she's walking over or something. But I'm losing weight. I've lost about a good 15 pounds. Hey that's great. Yeah. Someone came in today that hadn't been in a while and he's like, wow you really are looking good. I'm like oh thank you. Good. Yeah. They made me feel real nice."
719.88,760.60,SPEAKER_01, And so I don't know. I'm going to corner back on next Friday. What for? Go wedding my friend Javier. He's getting married. I don't I'm not excited. You know why? Because can we two dang hot in Mexico? Well it's so darn hot right now. It's in the hundreds. We fly in the day of F.A. and then we take a bus ride to Ho-hoot luck. And then the weddings on we fly in on Saturday. Then the weddings on Saturday and then they take us back to D.F. on Sunday. And I think I'm just going to stay in extra three days in Mexico City and view by myself. Oh my god. If you you go to oh my god. I have a friend in Mexico City. Oh oh. Oh. Oh. I'm going to go. Yeah. Okay.
760.60,772.52,SPEAKER_01, What's the name? Hold on. I've got to go play up to the other room to get the dog on address the telephone number. Oh. His name is Octavio and you have to call him until he is so cute. I really like him when he I met him here in St. Louis. Hold on. Okay. Okay.
772.52,774.52,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
781.72,786.52,SPEAKER_01, Blake? Yeah. Okay. This sounds strange because I'm not able to hang up the other one. I just want to hang up.
786.52,798.52,SPEAKER_01," Oh wait. Wrong book. Octavio what's his last name? Godfrax. D-A-R-V-A. Is he cute? He is really cute. I like him a lot. Is he tall? No. He's shorter than me. Oh, girl."
798.52,806.52,SPEAKER_01," I like him. He was so nice. You have to tell you have to call him. No matter what. Well, I want you to call him first and tell him I'm going."
806.52,812.52,SPEAKER_01, Crap. Blake. It's along to St. Paul. I'll pay for it. Listen. Here's his home number. Okay.
812.52,825.52,SPEAKER_01," Five, two. Yeah. Five. That might be the country and city code. Yeah. Sure. Okay. The one in Mexico City you call is five, four, three, nine, seven, eight, zero."
825.52,832.52,SPEAKER_01, Okay. That's his telephone number. Yeah. Okay. You have to call. He used to work from Ron's panel. I think he got a new job.
832.52,836.52,SPEAKER_01," I have a talk come for a while, but tell him Rachel is waiting for him. No."
836.52,849.52,SPEAKER_01," Oh, this is the men you met. They were at the hotel on a business trip. Yes. He called me one while I was here because I thought I was going down to Mexico City, but I ended up not going down."
849.52,858.52,SPEAKER_01," And he called to see what was going on. And I said I don't think I'm going to be Spanish or just English. Oh, he does. Yeah. And who does he live with?"
858.52,870.52,SPEAKER_01," Pardon? Who does he live with his brother? Oh, great. I want you to call him. I can call him. Okay. Maybe I will call him and tell him. Hey, you know what?"
870.52,880.52,SPEAKER_01, I have three way at the restaurant. Shall we call him from the restaurant? Then you don't have to pay. You know what? You're richer than I am. You can afford it.
880.52,895.52,SPEAKER_01, You big tight water. I'm going to tell when my friends coming down. Yeah. And I gave him your number. Yeah. Okay. I will call him tonight. Okay. Cool. Okay. So I'll be there on Sunday. So maybe I'll call him Sunday evening. Okay.
895.52,908.52,SPEAKER_01," Oh, wait. Maybe he can. Maybe I can stay with them. Well, see, when I was going to go down there, he didn't offer some hotels and he didn't offer to stay have me stay with them. So I didn't want to."
908.52,924.52,SPEAKER_01," Poor us and I didn't want to ask. So I don't want to ask. You know, anything like that. Well, just someone get a hotel. I don't want to hotel though. I wish I could stay with somebody. No, but that's good. Tell him I'm going to a wedding in full hoot law in Cuernavaca."
924.52,938.52,SPEAKER_01," On Saturday and that I'll be in Mexico City on Sunday and I would like to meet him. Okay. Maybe he can take me on to dinner and kiss me. Yeah. Oh, no. No, no, no. No. Oh, my man."
938.52,950.52,SPEAKER_00," Oh, really? Oh, I'm just getting excited. I'm going to meet two guys in Mexico City. I like the sky. Lotly. Oh, yeah."
950.52,963.52,SPEAKER_01," I didn't show what to him and he thought I didn't like him. Back he even said the lorry. Oh, she doesn't even like me. So I'm just going to go. And she's like, no, no, because I was talking to a friend's guy and she said, no, she likes Mexico better than France."
964.52,970.52,SPEAKER_01," Oh, I didn't make Tony. Hey, how's Lorde doing? Oh, she's fine. And she have a man."
970.52,979.52,SPEAKER_01, Kind of not really. I think she ought to leave him because they were going out and everything was hot and heavy and great. At least on her.
979.52,985.52,SPEAKER_01, But I saw some signs that were a little bit disturbing. Even my mom said like such a something weird.
985.52,989.52,SPEAKER_01, Like he would come back. He travels a lot. But his job he would come back. He's Spanish.
989.52,1005.52,SPEAKER_01," Oh, girl. He would come back and like not really be too anxious to see her or he wouldn't call her like he fought or he would kind of be annoyed when he did steer or whatever. And my mom and I both fought. There's something strange here. It's not the feelings of someone who really likes."
1005.52,1016.52,SPEAKER_01," Yeah. You know, gosh, dang it. But you know, I think that's our tendency to totally go overboard with men. And what's definitely her tendency. I'll tell you that she goes way overboard in my opinion."
1016.52,1025.52,SPEAKER_01," Well, I know I do too. But the guys just don't do that like I mean, I want to find a guy that gets interested in me like I get interested into a dude."
1025.52,1032.52,SPEAKER_01, Yeah. That just doesn't seem like it's ever going to happen. Wow. Get interested into him until like months later. I know.
1032.52,1038.52,SPEAKER_01," I wish that you'd rub off on me a little. But unfortunately, I don't think that's going to. Hey, I'm not."
1038.52,1052.52,SPEAKER_01," He said to her, we're going to what he said to her. But when he said what's the deal here? Say wait for you when you go in these trips or what's the deal? He's like, no, that's unfair. You know, the only thing different between a friend that's a girl and a girlfriend is that you sleep with your girlfriend."
1052.52,1054.52,SPEAKER_01, God.
1054.52,1067.52,SPEAKER_01," I'm just your girl. I'm just a friend. I'm just a friend that's a girl then. Yeah. Oh, you did that. Oh, I bet you that's nearing the end of our conversation or something."
1067.52,1077.52,SPEAKER_01," Oh, no. They give you a warning. What do you think they're using it for? Probably to do a examine accents and dialect and vocabulary."
1077.52,1088.52,SPEAKER_01," Well, let's do some good vocabulary. Yeah, send tax and all that kind of stuff. Because they also are doing it for other other languages like Native Mandarin and Egyptian Arabic and so forth."
1088.52,1096.52,SPEAKER_01," So I put in the announcement out for the students that if they're interested in co-impshooting a far-call plus $30, $10 they can do that."
1096.52,1104.52,SPEAKER_01," That's great. So how many times can you call me? Just one time I can send you the application. Oh, no. Yeah, send me the application."
1104.52,1112.52,SPEAKER_01," Then you can also then I'll call somebody. Yeah. Yeah, with the person that gets their phone disconnected. I can sure use a half an hour free. That's right."
1112.52,1125.52,SPEAKER_01," This is, hey, so have you ever seen Samina around? No. No, I haven't. Me neither. Any anyone more gothker from the hello. Oh, that's my dad. You haven't got the other phone. Oh, any more gothker from the flu ended town?"
