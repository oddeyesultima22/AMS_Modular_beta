0.00,2.00,SPEAKER_00," Okay, how are you doing?"
2.00,4.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm not going to do that.
4.00,5.00,SPEAKER_00, I'm not going to do that.
5.00,7.00,SPEAKER_00, I'm not going to do that.
7.00,8.00,SPEAKER_00, How do you do that?
8.00,9.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm not going to do that.
9.00,10.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm not going to do that.
10.00,11.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm not going to do that.
11.00,12.00,SPEAKER_02, I don't know.
12.00,16.00,SPEAKER_00, They said it was supposed to be just a computer but analyze it for voice patterns.
16.00,19.00,SPEAKER_00," This is Galla, it does all the foreign students."
19.00,29.00,SPEAKER_00, It's something I think with because they were encouraging us to try and get foreign students to use it too so they can analyze voice patterns and that kind of stuff.
29.00,30.00,SPEAKER_00, I know.
30.00,33.00,SPEAKER_00, I never have a half-hour talk free.
33.00,35.00,SPEAKER_00, Does she tell us to hang up?
35.00,36.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, okay."
36.00,38.00,SPEAKER_02, Did Daddy call you last night?
38.00,39.00,SPEAKER_02," Okay, so yeah."
39.00,42.00,SPEAKER_02, He's going to be at your house like Monday.
42.00,44.00,SPEAKER_00," Monday is afternoon, yeah."
44.00,45.00,SPEAKER_00, The 31st.
45.00,46.00,SPEAKER_02," Okay, yes."
46.00,50.00,SPEAKER_02, He's spending three nights at your house and only two nights at my house.
50.00,52.00,SPEAKER_00, He said you would never recover.
52.00,53.00,SPEAKER_00, I don't know.
53.00,54.00,SPEAKER_02, The warped forever.
54.00,55.00,SPEAKER_00, Yes.
55.00,56.00,SPEAKER_00, Heartbreak hotel.
56.00,57.00,SPEAKER_00, I know.
57.00,62.00,SPEAKER_00, I guess a bad that I have to teach on Tuesday night but I guess that's the way it goes.
62.00,64.00,SPEAKER_02, Well that kind of makes up to the night then.
64.00,77.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, and like I said, if I didn't have to teach Thursday night I would just write down with them and then stay and then have to head come down Saturday but I don't feel like I can ditch out the next or the last class."
77.00,79.00,SPEAKER_02, That would be a real swell plan.
79.00,80.00,SPEAKER_00, I know.
80.00,82.00,SPEAKER_00, Maybe I might think about it.
82.00,85.00,SPEAKER_00, I don't know if I could get anybody to sub for me or not.
85.00,86.00,SPEAKER_02, I think that would be a real swell.
86.00,89.00,SPEAKER_00," You know, a few extra days for everybody to be together."
89.00,95.00,SPEAKER_02," Because I think Mitch might take off Thursday and Friday too, at least one of the days."
95.00,96.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
96.00,98.00,SPEAKER_02, So that we can go do some same things.
98.00,99.00,SPEAKER_02, I don't know.
99.00,101.00,SPEAKER_02, Daddy probably wouldn't like to shop but that new outlet mall.
101.00,102.00,SPEAKER_00, Oh yeah.
102.00,106.00,SPEAKER_02, It's open and I know Mary would probably like to go over there and it's really close.
106.00,111.00,SPEAKER_02, It's like it's 15 miles but you know when you go each you can go 65 miles an hour.
111.00,112.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
112.00,113.00,SPEAKER_02, Oh yeah.
113.00,115.00,SPEAKER_02, It's about 10 minutes to get there.
115.00,117.00,SPEAKER_00, Let me try and work on finding the sub.
117.00,118.00,SPEAKER_00, See if I can do it.
118.00,119.00,SPEAKER_00, You might do it for me maybe.
119.00,122.00,SPEAKER_02, And they have 45 stores and there.
122.00,124.00,SPEAKER_02," You know, I thought the prices, yeah."
124.00,126.00,SPEAKER_02, I thought it was a pretty good old mall.
126.00,127.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
127.00,128.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
128.00,129.00,SPEAKER_00, I know because we've got that one.
129.00,133.00,SPEAKER_00, I don't think we've been taking you over to it here but it's between here and Lincoln.
133.00,134.00,SPEAKER_00, It's maybe 20 minutes.
134.00,138.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, it takes to get there but there's no stores I like."
138.00,139.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, I like."
139.00,140.00,SPEAKER_00, Oh really?
140.00,141.00,SPEAKER_00, I can't even think of what they are.
141.00,146.00,SPEAKER_00, They said they ask you outlet and those are always as expensive or more expensive than the store.
146.00,150.00,SPEAKER_00, It seems to me like now and some kitchen places and some I don't know.
150.00,154.00,SPEAKER_00, Well this one has China and I don't know stuff that I'm not interested.
154.00,155.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
155.00,161.00,SPEAKER_02, This one has some kitchen places in China too and but they have a spiggle outlet is there.
161.00,162.00,SPEAKER_02, Oh.
162.00,163.00,SPEAKER_02, And a lot.
163.00,167.00,SPEAKER_02, And then let me say well I've got this list of stores here.
167.00,174.00,SPEAKER_02," It was in the paper and I cut it out so the girls could because they didn't have any little um flyers, you know, listed in their stores."
174.00,178.00,SPEAKER_02, But let me see if they have a Merrick Trister.
178.00,180.00,SPEAKER_02, Now their bath store doesn't have shoes.
180.00,183.00,SPEAKER_02, It's called a bath company store and it's all closed.
183.00,184.00,SPEAKER_00, Interesting.
184.00,185.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
185.00,186.00,SPEAKER_02, The main clothes.
186.00,187.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
187.00,189.00,SPEAKER_02," And then it has Bugle Boy, casual corner outlet and then casual corner woman outlet."
189.00,190.00,SPEAKER_02, We didn't get around to all of it.
190.00,191.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
191.00,192.00,SPEAKER_00, That's how many for Mary.
192.00,193.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
193.00,196.00,SPEAKER_02," And then it has Claire's, you know, the, all the earrings."
196.00,197.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
197.00,198.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
198.00,199.00,SPEAKER_02, That'd be cool.
199.00,200.00,SPEAKER_02, And then a cornering reviewer county seat.
200.00,201.00,SPEAKER_02, That's a clothes.
201.00,202.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
202.00,203.00,SPEAKER_02, Eddie Bauer.
203.00,205.00,SPEAKER_02, Of course I've never got to the girl in place.
205.00,207.00,SPEAKER_02," And then that at May, on May or May."
207.00,208.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
208.00,209.00,SPEAKER_02, They have that.
209.00,210.00,SPEAKER_02, And she plays.
210.00,215.00,SPEAKER_02," Let's see here for her house where a floor from shoes, Jeffrey Bean, Harry and David."
215.00,216.00,SPEAKER_02, I don't know what that is.
216.00,219.00,SPEAKER_02," Jackie, Jones of New York, and the two."
219.00,221.00,SPEAKER_02, And then they've got a couple of other places.
221.00,222.00,SPEAKER_00, They've never get into your bow places.
222.00,223.00,SPEAKER_00, But they never do.
223.00,224.00,SPEAKER_02, Never get what?
224.00,225.00,SPEAKER_00, You're going to get into your bow.
225.00,227.00,SPEAKER_00," Um, Brandon Jean to the likes."
227.00,229.00,SPEAKER_02," Um, now there's, that's not on him."
229.00,237.00,SPEAKER_00," I had never, and it's one of the things that whenever a store has a sale of 20% off anything or something, it's always excluded, you know."
237.00,238.00,SPEAKER_00, Jesus.
238.00,239.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
239.00,240.00,SPEAKER_02, I like that.
240.00,241.00,SPEAKER_02, The pros have never bought that.
241.00,242.00,SPEAKER_00, That's the only thing I can't be anything.
242.00,243.00,SPEAKER_00, I don't know.
243.00,244.00,SPEAKER_01, I don't wear them.
244.00,245.00,SPEAKER_02, I don't think.
245.00,246.00,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
246.00,247.00,SPEAKER_02, Cause I've never heard of talk about that.
247.00,249.00,SPEAKER_02, And I've got legs and leavies.
249.00,250.00,SPEAKER_02, Music for a song.
250.00,251.00,SPEAKER_02, Nordic track.
251.00,252.00,SPEAKER_02, Oshkosh.
252.00,256.00,SPEAKER_02, The two tips to get us on mother by like that when she's here now.
256.00,257.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm sure.
257.00,258.00,SPEAKER_02, And a rebox.
258.00,259.00,SPEAKER_02, Lucky mountain chocolate factory.
259.00,260.00,SPEAKER_02, I don't know.
260.00,261.00,SPEAKER_02, Daddy said that.
261.00,262.00,SPEAKER_00, I'm not so bad.
262.00,265.00,SPEAKER_00," I saw a wing of the zoo and he said, no, no, we don't want to go anywhere."
265.00,266.00,SPEAKER_00, We just want to sit around and talk.
266.00,267.00,SPEAKER_00, Oh.
267.00,268.00,SPEAKER_02, And I have to see her zoo.
268.00,269.00,SPEAKER_00, It's really cool.
269.00,272.00,SPEAKER_00, It's got the jungle and the penguins and the shark.
272.00,273.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, yeah."
273.00,274.00,SPEAKER_00," And then I said, okay."
274.00,275.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
275.00,276.00,SPEAKER_00," You know, I just sit around and talk."
276.00,277.00,SPEAKER_00, I just want to go with some money.
277.00,279.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, I mean, I want to do some of that."
279.00,282.00,SPEAKER_00," But you know, I've not decided that, you know, I want to wear them."
282.00,284.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, you know, I still have to go to Mr. C's."
284.00,287.00,SPEAKER_00," The plastic grapes and the whites and they said, yeah, we have to go there."
287.00,291.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, even at the beach, you know, who's the one who always wants to go to ask a lot?"
291.00,292.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, whole lot."
292.00,293.00,SPEAKER_00, All right.
293.00,294.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, exactly."
294.00,297.00,SPEAKER_00, I think he feels like he needs dinner to clean that out there.
297.00,298.00,SPEAKER_02, But then he's a goer.
298.00,299.00,SPEAKER_02, And the door he gets tired.
299.00,300.00,SPEAKER_00, He gets tired.
300.00,301.00,SPEAKER_02, But he likes to go to.
301.00,303.00,SPEAKER_02, I figure he loves that Nelson art gallery.
303.00,304.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
304.00,306.00,SPEAKER_02," So I figure we'll go to, and I haven't been there for quite a while."
306.00,307.00,SPEAKER_02," And they all, they change it a lot."
307.00,308.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, you know, it's exhibit."
308.00,309.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
309.00,314.00,SPEAKER_02, So I thought we'd go down there and have lunch in that atrium type deal they have there.
314.00,318.00,SPEAKER_00," And the thing is, he doesn't want to go blank for a whole day necessarily."
318.00,322.00,SPEAKER_00," But if he goes someplace part of the day, I think that breaks it."
322.00,323.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
323.00,325.00,SPEAKER_02," Kind of, you know, and that's kind of what I figured we'd do."
325.00,327.00,SPEAKER_00, And I have better from money yesterday.
327.00,330.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, what is your own kind of interesting stuff?"
330.00,331.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, really?"
331.00,332.00,SPEAKER_00, Just a little bit.
332.00,333.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
333.00,336.00,SPEAKER_00, She told you that or not about how they had an opera in their house and stuff.
336.00,341.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, she did tell me they had an opera, because that called her to talk to her about the opera playing together."
341.00,342.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
342.00,345.00,SPEAKER_02," And I said, well, what are they asking for the house?"
345.00,346.00,SPEAKER_02, And she didn't know.
346.00,348.00,SPEAKER_02," She just knew the opera was $30,000 below."
348.00,350.00,SPEAKER_00, But Todd told me they were asking $260.
350.00,351.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, really?"
351.00,352.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
352.00,354.00,SPEAKER_00," And he's, or $259."
354.00,355.00,SPEAKER_00, I can't remember what he said.
355.00,358.00,SPEAKER_00, We said they had it like at $260.
358.00,363.00,SPEAKER_00, And the agent said they should put it like $259 or something.
363.00,364.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
364.00,369.00,SPEAKER_00," Because some people, they should probably put it like $250."
369.00,373.00,SPEAKER_00, It would be a normal cut-off place for a lot more people.
373.00,374.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, yeah."
374.00,378.00,SPEAKER_02," And well, but the thing about that, some people look a little hard and then offer $250."
378.00,379.00,SPEAKER_02, Right.
379.00,380.00,SPEAKER_02, You know?
380.00,382.00,SPEAKER_02, It's so noisy.
382.00,384.00,SPEAKER_02, I hate it when the girls do that when I'm on the phone.
384.00,385.00,SPEAKER_02, What is it?
385.00,386.00,SPEAKER_02, The ice maker.
386.00,387.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, for sure."
387.00,391.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, it just sounds like an air-coise you can't hear a thing when that's on."
391.00,393.00,SPEAKER_02, What did they pay for the house?
393.00,395.00,SPEAKER_00, What did they pay to?
395.00,396.00,SPEAKER_00, What?
396.00,397.00,SPEAKER_00, $225 or something?
397.00,398.00,SPEAKER_00, And then they put in the pool.
398.00,399.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
399.00,403.00,SPEAKER_00, And she said she said it was $20 below their bottom line.
403.00,405.00,SPEAKER_00, So apparently they're willing to go downtown.
405.00,406.00,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
406.00,409.00,SPEAKER_00," But to me, just sound a freaking thing."
409.00,411.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, if they had an offer, they should jump on it."
411.00,417.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, I mean, when you look at what happened, come in, come in, come in, in his house, and they can take that loss on their taxes."
417.00,418.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
418.00,420.00,SPEAKER_02," You know, I mean, you can recoup that a little bit."
420.00,421.00,SPEAKER_00, There could even be a loss.
421.00,422.00,SPEAKER_00, I don't know what the pool cost.
422.00,425.00,SPEAKER_00," But it'd probably be about, well, 230, that would be lost."
425.00,426.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
426.00,427.00,SPEAKER_02, They would take a loss on it.
427.00,428.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
428.00,431.00,SPEAKER_02," But you could, like I said, you can write that off too on your taxes."
431.00,435.00,SPEAKER_00," And because students of mine, you'd think would be wanting to get rid of it."
435.00,436.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, yeah."
436.00,437.00,SPEAKER_00, Because she's still in the same thing.
437.00,438.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, yeah."
438.00,439.00,SPEAKER_00, At least time gets to live there or so.
439.00,440.00,SPEAKER_02, I know.
440.00,447.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, I know when Mitch sold his stock to get the money and build their house, he had to sell it a loss."
447.00,449.00,SPEAKER_02, And we've taken that loss on the tax return.
449.00,451.00,SPEAKER_02," I think next year's the last year, we get to take it."
451.00,454.00,SPEAKER_02," And he said, that'll really hurt us when we get to take that anymore."
454.00,455.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
455.00,458.00,SPEAKER_02, And I forget you can take some X number of dollars a year.
458.00,459.00,SPEAKER_00, Right here.
459.00,460.00,SPEAKER_02, Right there.
460.00,461.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
461.00,462.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
462.00,463.00,SPEAKER_02, You can stretch it out.
463.00,464.00,SPEAKER_02, That'll be gone.
464.00,465.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
465.00,466.00,SPEAKER_00," But you know, that's kind of a nice, well, especially if he's going to be a single person."
466.00,467.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
467.00,473.00,SPEAKER_00," And he said that he said, maybe when I'm in foul to divorce, and then that wasn't an issue, the main thing was selling the house first."
473.00,475.00,SPEAKER_00, And then they could get the rest of it in order.
475.00,479.00,SPEAKER_00, So there's something about that Julie is really butched out.
479.00,480.00,SPEAKER_00, I guess she's got her hair cut.
480.00,481.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, really?"
481.00,482.00,SPEAKER_00, Short is the main.
482.00,484.00,SPEAKER_00," And our shorter than a lot of ends, you know."
484.00,490.00,SPEAKER_00," And my parents, she's so funny when she writes something about she thought Susan was the man and the relationship."
490.00,492.00,SPEAKER_00," And then she said, I don't know much about this."
492.00,494.00,SPEAKER_00, Can both of them meet men?
494.00,495.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
495.00,498.00,SPEAKER_00, So it's just kind of funny.
498.00,499.00,SPEAKER_00, See.
499.00,502.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, Susan definitely wants to be a man."
502.00,503.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
503.00,506.00,SPEAKER_00," But then, seven gals got her hair butched that short."
506.00,507.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
507.00,509.00,SPEAKER_02, She sounds like she wants to be a man too.
509.00,512.00,SPEAKER_00, She's a like mother of those who know maybe they can both be men.
512.00,515.00,SPEAKER_02, I guess that is just so bizarre.
515.00,516.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
516.00,520.00,SPEAKER_02," But like I said, I think the red flags were there all along and we chose to ignore them."
520.00,521.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
521.00,523.00,SPEAKER_02, Because we wanted happiness for Todd.
523.00,524.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, yeah."
524.00,525.00,SPEAKER_00, That was my very free spot.
525.00,526.00,SPEAKER_00," They thought, oh, don't be so mean."
526.00,527.00,SPEAKER_00, Don't even say that.
527.00,528.00,SPEAKER_00, You know.
528.00,529.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
529.00,532.00,SPEAKER_00, I looked out that window and they were in the backyard and it took me a minute to decide
532.00,534.00,SPEAKER_02, which one was Todd. Yeah.
534.00,535.00,SPEAKER_00," Like, yeah."
535.00,547.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, I'll never forget that night when they were before the wedding when she said, when she mentioned that girlfriend and how, you know, she thought, you know, this girlfriend at work said they couldn't be friends anymore and she told her that was so."
547.00,548.00,SPEAKER_02," And I thought, why?"
548.00,549.00,SPEAKER_02, She told me about a girlfriend.
549.00,550.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
550.00,551.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
551.00,552.00,SPEAKER_01," I remember dancing, you know."
552.00,553.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, yeah."
553.00,556.00,SPEAKER_02," All the little bells went off in my head but I just thought, no, no, no, no."
556.00,557.00,SPEAKER_00, You know.
557.00,563.96,SPEAKER_00, I know there's a lady in our office who was married and got divorced and her last kids graduated from high school and she was talking about this.
563.96,568.96,SPEAKER_00," She was going to sell her house and get a small place and she wanted to be out in the country and blah, blah, blah."
568.96,569.96,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
569.96,576.48,SPEAKER_00," And I've seen her years ago at a restaurant with a lady and, you know, and they acted guilty when you saw them."
576.48,587.36,SPEAKER_00," You know, it was a Saturday night, you know, but it was kind of like, in it was a small restaurant that I had other people picked it but it was like way out of the way and not a place I'd ever been before ever heard of."
587.36,588.36,SPEAKER_02, Right.
588.36,589.36,SPEAKER_00, And there she was.
589.36,591.36,SPEAKER_00," And so she kind of, it was, it was just a little bit different than it normally was."
591.36,598.36,SPEAKER_00," And I thought that's kind of strange and then I thought they kind of looked like they were, you know, pretty close and stuff."
598.36,603.60,SPEAKER_00," And so anyway then my secretary told me that they said, oh, Miranda was in today's just about a house."
603.60,605.36,SPEAKER_00," I said, well, she was talking this spring and she said something."
605.36,608.36,SPEAKER_00," She was going to and stuff and she said, well, she bought it with another lady."
608.36,616.36,SPEAKER_00," And I told her about seeing her in the restaurant and how they acted kind of weird and stuff and she said, why boys kind of wondered about her?"
616.36,617.36,SPEAKER_00, She's a real man-hater.
617.36,621.88,SPEAKER_00," And she was just, I just figured that was because she went through a bad divorce and he really did."
621.88,622.88,SPEAKER_00, He ran around.
622.88,625.80,SPEAKER_00, He had another woman and kind of a bad deal for her.
625.80,629.12,SPEAKER_00," So, but anyways, you know, it just all makes sense."
629.12,638.96,SPEAKER_00," Like you said, the little signals were kind of there but you just go, that's, you know, don't jump to conclusions, you know, because the lady's out with another woman, you know, that doesn't mean she's a lesbian or anything."
638.96,644.08,SPEAKER_00," And then I really thought even if they lived together, I suppose they don't necessarily have to have a sexual relationship."
644.08,645.08,SPEAKER_00, No.
645.08,657.48,SPEAKER_00," And I've not been doing that before and I still think if something happened to Ted, you know, later on and I had a woman friend that I enjoyed and stuff, I wouldn't, you know, I'd be opposed to the place together or something to share her with that."
657.48,661.88,SPEAKER_00, But then having a companion and stuff and it wouldn't mean we were sleeping together.
661.88,668.28,SPEAKER_02," But each to their own, it's just too bad taught had to be caught in something and I say,"
668.28,670.28,SPEAKER_00, get messed up with all that.
670.28,675.28,SPEAKER_02, And I guess you're still going to church every Sunday. But as you stop by and as a way to church or something.
675.28,680.88,SPEAKER_02," And so I don't know, maybe you can find somebody else's church, you know, I think that"
680.88,686.08,SPEAKER_00," would be better, you know, yeah. And then quit going over to see her parents and stuff."
686.08,688.88,SPEAKER_00, I think that's just kind of prolonging me how it is.
688.88,690.88,SPEAKER_02, But I think you need that.
690.88,691.88,SPEAKER_00, You do it.
691.88,692.88,SPEAKER_02, Right.
692.88,693.88,SPEAKER_02, You have to go gradually.
693.88,694.88,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
694.88,698.28,SPEAKER_00," And when, when, you know, when that's not right for him anymore."
698.28,699.28,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
699.28,700.28,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
700.28,704.28,SPEAKER_00," I mean, poor and well, brother, but it's going to be done fine really."
704.28,705.28,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
705.28,706.28,SPEAKER_00," So, yeah."
706.28,707.28,SPEAKER_00, But it was just kind of interesting.
707.28,710.28,SPEAKER_00, And then she wrote some staff about Mary Blakeland.
710.28,711.28,SPEAKER_00," Oh, really?"
711.28,712.28,SPEAKER_00, I think I got to get this way.
712.28,713.28,SPEAKER_00, It's just right over here.
713.28,714.28,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
714.28,715.28,SPEAKER_00, This is free.
715.28,716.28,SPEAKER_00, I'll just take a second.
716.28,717.28,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
717.28,732.88,SPEAKER_00," I had everything here right under my call, but I had my, my banana and everything."
732.88,733.88,SPEAKER_00, I'll be here.
733.88,734.88,SPEAKER_00, I forgot this letter.
734.88,739.16,SPEAKER_00," Oh, she said, um, I went out to see Mary last week."
739.16,743.88,SPEAKER_00, They've moved her from the therapy department to a regular room and her roomy is a black woman.
743.88,748.40,SPEAKER_00, Mary was out of the nursing station waiting for Bill and Leslie in to pick her up and take her home.
748.40,751.24,SPEAKER_00," They told me she's been doing the, for a couple of days."
751.24,754.60,SPEAKER_00, She did know me and kept asking where I thought she should wait.
754.60,757.08,SPEAKER_00, Then she asked me to take her home and I told her I couldn't.
757.08,759.84,SPEAKER_00, Then she wanted me to call them and see when they were coming.
759.84,765.88,SPEAKER_00," Finally, I tried to explain they weren't coming and she asked who isn't coming."
765.88,770.88,SPEAKER_00," So, my heart had the, I told her I had to go and laugh."
770.88,776.08,SPEAKER_00," I had tried to get her to go back to her room, but she kept asking me why I said that was her room."
776.08,777.08,SPEAKER_00, So sad.
777.08,778.96,SPEAKER_00, I surely hope I never end up in that state.
778.96,781.16,SPEAKER_00," If I do, don't ever come see me and break your heart."
781.16,785.24,SPEAKER_00, I better remember me as I was not in that condition.
785.24,786.24,SPEAKER_00, No.
786.24,790.28,SPEAKER_00, Trying to see if she said anything else about God.
790.28,796.48,SPEAKER_00," Oh, yeah, she said he was going up to Baltimore for a week."
796.48,797.48,SPEAKER_00," So she was, yeah."
797.48,798.48,SPEAKER_00," She had, yeah."
798.48,799.48,SPEAKER_00, She told me that.
799.48,805.02,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, she would have offered house 3,000 less than asking for a $20,000 less than their bottom line."
805.02,806.84,SPEAKER_00, And the people wouldn't negotiate.
806.84,808.60,SPEAKER_00, Susan is still concerned about her job.
808.60,814.48,SPEAKER_00," I don't understand exactly what Todd told me, something about the hospital taking on a managed healthcare plan."
814.48,827.00,SPEAKER_00," And then her floor might be totally eliminated, in which case she would have to resign from the hospital and apply to the managed care people or take whatever shift the hospital chose to give her no job outside of government seems to be security stays."
827.00,828.00,SPEAKER_00, Teaching is.
829.00,836.56,SPEAKER_00," He said neither of them has filed for divorce, as it's just a formality in that getting the household is the first order of business, the rest can come later."
836.56,841.08,SPEAKER_00, He said a VA lawyer who is planning to leave and open a private practice that he did divorce for nothing.
841.08,844.28,SPEAKER_00, But the only thing the court is concerned with is how the property is divided.
844.28,847.12,SPEAKER_00, This will be very simple and no children are involved.
847.12,851.16,SPEAKER_00," And Ted bit, Todd said that Julie has really butched and closed."
851.16,853.24,SPEAKER_00, Because her haircut touch showered.
853.24,856.76,SPEAKER_00, So they always figured Susan was the male partner in that relationship.
856.76,863.76,SPEAKER_00, She said she was the first person to do two lesbians ever but for it to be managed.
863.76,868.76,SPEAKER_00, Oh and it's a little me how much I have yet to learn.
868.76,871.76,SPEAKER_02, That was about it.
871.76,875.76,SPEAKER_00, For mother she's the one who needs to get out and do some.
875.76,876.76,SPEAKER_00, Oh I know.
876.76,877.76,SPEAKER_00, Just so.
877.76,880.76,SPEAKER_00," Since I've been home, I mean I love it but I do."
880.76,883.76,SPEAKER_00, I need for Ted to come home at night and stuff.
883.76,885.76,SPEAKER_00, I don't know how much or do anything he did.
885.76,890.76,SPEAKER_02, Well I can remember that like during the summer when Dean would be out of town.
890.76,895.12,SPEAKER_02, During the winter it was okay because I was a work all day and I had kids and I enjoyed the quiet evening.
895.12,898.12,SPEAKER_02, But during the summer when I was there just by my home.
898.12,900.64,SPEAKER_02, That's when I always came up and visited you.
900.64,902.64,SPEAKER_02, Because you just get lonely.
902.64,903.64,SPEAKER_02, And I just can't imagine.
903.64,906.96,SPEAKER_02, I mean even grandma talked to Anne Fern every day and that bridge.
906.96,911.76,SPEAKER_00, And regular almost every day that she went out and church circular.
911.76,912.76,SPEAKER_00, I love her.
912.76,913.76,SPEAKER_00, A lot of things.
913.76,914.76,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
914.76,915.76,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
915.76,918.76,SPEAKER_00, Kind of not just a fear that she talked to and yeah I just can't imagine.
918.76,919.76,SPEAKER_00, No I can't either.
919.76,920.76,SPEAKER_00, How she could stand it.
920.76,921.76,SPEAKER_00, I don't know.
921.76,926.76,SPEAKER_02, I don't know either but you can't make her go out and get activities.
926.76,929.76,SPEAKER_02, You know every she complains and criticizes everything.
929.76,930.76,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
930.76,932.76,SPEAKER_02, Did that volunteer work and she hated that.
932.76,936.76,SPEAKER_00, That yeah yeah tried one little thing and then didn't like that.
936.76,939.76,SPEAKER_00, Yeah it's just like one afternoon a month or whatever it was.
939.76,940.76,SPEAKER_00, It kind of was.
940.76,942.76,SPEAKER_02, It kind of like ordering that clock that she wanted.
942.76,945.76,SPEAKER_00, I think you told me that she had to do something.
945.76,946.76,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
946.76,947.76,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
947.76,948.76,SPEAKER_02, She was never order mail order.
948.76,949.76,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
949.76,950.76,SPEAKER_02, It's kind of the same attitude you know.
950.76,953.76,SPEAKER_02, Well I didn't like that volunteering so I'll never do that.
953.76,954.76,SPEAKER_00, Every day.
954.76,955.76,SPEAKER_00, Every day.
955.76,956.76,SPEAKER_00, Every day.
956.76,957.76,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
957.76,959.76,SPEAKER_00, And every thinking that you know well that was maybe not what I wanted but there could be some else there.
959.76,961.76,SPEAKER_00, You know she reminded me she was so close to everything.
961.76,963.76,SPEAKER_02, Yeah that's exactly what it is.
963.76,964.76,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
964.76,965.76,SPEAKER_02, Absolutely close.
965.76,967.76,SPEAKER_02, And you just have to force her to you know.
967.76,970.76,SPEAKER_02, Which is like a staested open house.
970.76,973.76,SPEAKER_02, I mean I wasn't really looking forward to that either.
973.76,975.76,SPEAKER_02, But she wanted to do it and I know it would be okay.
975.76,978.76,SPEAKER_02, And mother I mean for like two days before hand she could say I'm just dreading this.
978.76,979.76,SPEAKER_02, I'm just dreading this.
979.76,980.76,SPEAKER_01, I'm just dreading this.
980.76,981.76,SPEAKER_02, I can imagine yeah.
981.76,985.76,SPEAKER_02, I mean you would have thought that she was going to be led to you know a culture session or something.
985.76,986.76,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
986.76,989.76,SPEAKER_02, And I said mother just do the food and you don't have to talk to anybody.
989.76,992.76,SPEAKER_02, You know I said that's something you can do that will help me out and it will keep you busy.
992.76,994.76,SPEAKER_02, And you won't have to mess with anybody.
994.76,996.76,SPEAKER_02, I know but I'm just dreading it.
996.76,997.76,SPEAKER_02, This is just not me.
997.76,999.76,SPEAKER_02, I just want to shrink back into my little corner.
999.76,1002.76,SPEAKER_02, You know I think she will enjoy that.
1002.76,1005.76,SPEAKER_00, Yeah because a lot of quite social and talk to a lot of people.
1005.76,1006.76,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1006.76,1010.76,SPEAKER_02, And everything and she was just you know and I just thought you know I have had those feelings too.
1010.76,1013.76,SPEAKER_02, But you just say a little be fine and do it.
1013.76,1016.76,SPEAKER_02, Yeah you know and yeah I hope I never get that way.
1016.76,1023.76,SPEAKER_00, And we're hard of that is all they I've noticed the older I get the less outgoing I am and I do enjoy stuff like that.
1023.76,1027.76,SPEAKER_00, So I'm thinking she's in 30 years or 20 years or whatever you know.
1027.76,1029.76,SPEAKER_00, Yeah I hope I don't hope I don't.
1029.76,1037.76,SPEAKER_00, Yeah and I hope you know like I say we need to remind each other for getting that way because I see more and more you know things I used to enjoy doing.
1037.76,1041.76,SPEAKER_00, I just don't care to do anymore you know and a lot of more people kind of things.
1041.76,1042.76,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1042.76,1052.76,SPEAKER_00, Like I see myself becoming more and more of a hermit and I kind of worried that I'm too dependent on Ted because he has a lot of friends that he has lunch with and you know that he and I really don't.
1052.76,1057.76,SPEAKER_00, I mean he's about my only real friend you know I mean everything I do basically I do with him now.
1057.76,1058.76,SPEAKER_00, We are really good friends.
1058.76,1065.76,SPEAKER_00, Yeah I think we went over here to see if we had it was a fun time or even when we when you lived in that little apartment we just laid in the pool.
1065.76,1066.76,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1066.76,1070.76,SPEAKER_00, I got burned up too but anyway I had sunscreen I was still got a chance.
1070.76,1072.76,SPEAKER_00, I guess I should say.
1072.76,1082.96,SPEAKER_00, But and I do have a couple like Lois and I went to lunch the other day and I mean I need to call Debbie off key and do lunch with her before she goes back to work and you know there's people there at the M.L.
1082.96,1087.76,SPEAKER_00, Land even too that I could if I wanted to talk to more do things with.
1087.76,1088.76,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1088.76,1092.76,SPEAKER_00, But I just I really don't you know and as far as going out or anything I never do.
1092.76,1098.76,SPEAKER_02, I guess my thing is still that I still see a lot of women through the kids.
1098.76,1099.76,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1099.76,1109.26,SPEAKER_02, You know like you know I mean I went to 10 or three times a week now I didn't stay except on Fridays but Fridays you know I would because they played their matches.
1109.26,1114.26,SPEAKER_02, So I'd stay and Diane would come and stay and usually Carolyn would show up and you know which is there and talk and you know what I'm saying.
1114.26,1115.26,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1115.26,1122.26,SPEAKER_02, And then you know I still go over to Lloyd is now and then and catch up on things with her and you know just so I think part of it is just neighborhood.
1122.26,1123.26,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1123.26,1136.26,SPEAKER_02, You know you see people and you know people and they'll have like graces having a dinner party Saturday night so we'll go down there and you know that kind of thing and like there's two or three the girls that walk all the time they're always walking if I'm outside and they come by you know that's stop and talk.
1136.26,1144.26,SPEAKER_02, So it's not you know there's there's people that I see and have contact with all the time even though it's just on a very casual basis.
1144.26,1146.26,SPEAKER_02, But I think Mother even has that.
1146.26,1151.26,SPEAKER_02, Oh no she doesn't chat with her neighbors or anything like that.
1151.26,1153.26,SPEAKER_02, And that's kind of something grandma had.
1153.26,1154.26,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1154.26,1160.26,SPEAKER_02, People that she'd always lived around and been around and you know the bridge group and like I could play that when in that group if I wanted to.
1160.26,1162.26,SPEAKER_02, And I just don't because of working.
1162.26,1163.26,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1163.26,1169.26,SPEAKER_02, But I always figure with some time you know when the kids are gone and the other thing is that it's on Wednesday night and that's one of my nights with kids.
1169.26,1170.26,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1170.26,1172.26,SPEAKER_02, They're gone on Monday and Thursday anyway.
1172.26,1177.26,SPEAKER_02, But I figure you know once they're gone I'll let them know that I'm a bit they always need a sub.
1177.26,1178.26,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1178.26,1179.26,SPEAKER_02, There's always somebody like can't come.
1179.26,1182.26,SPEAKER_00, So I could do by playing I'm only a sub but I play every month.
1182.26,1183.26,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1183.26,1185.26,SPEAKER_02, And yet if you don't want to you don't feel obligated.
1185.26,1186.26,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1186.26,1187.26,SPEAKER_00, And you don't love any of them.
1187.26,1188.26,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1188.26,1189.26,SPEAKER_00, And you don't have to have.
1189.26,1190.26,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1190.26,1191.26,SPEAKER_02, So after you're home.
1191.26,1192.26,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1192.26,1195.26,SPEAKER_02, You know once the girls are gone I'll make them let them know that I'm available to sub again.
1195.26,1201.26,SPEAKER_02," And you know it's just kind of like, oh there's just because you did because you know that's the thing about this neighborhood."
1201.26,1202.26,SPEAKER_02, It is like a little small town.
1202.26,1203.26,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1203.26,1207.26,SPEAKER_02, And I'll always know these people as long as I live here and I'll always have contact with them.
1207.26,1209.26,SPEAKER_02, But she's just like isolated from the world.
1209.26,1210.26,SPEAKER_00, Oh yeah.
1210.26,1211.26,SPEAKER_00, She's just really.
1211.26,1212.26,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1212.26,1217.26,SPEAKER_00, And if I do worry that she's going to die sooner because of the act because I really think that.
1217.26,1219.26,SPEAKER_02, Well say I'm a remorgia about daddy over something.
1219.26,1221.26,SPEAKER_02, I say I worry more about daddy's health.
1221.26,1222.26,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1222.26,1223.26,SPEAKER_00, His health is worse I think.
1223.26,1226.26,SPEAKER_02," I think it is just you know that arthritic, everything."
1226.26,1227.26,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1227.26,1228.26,SPEAKER_02, I think other all loved to be 100 too.
1228.26,1229.26,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1229.26,1230.26,SPEAKER_02, She just sits there and gets feistered and feistered.
1230.26,1231.26,SPEAKER_00, Maybe.
1231.26,1232.26,SPEAKER_00, I don't know.
1232.26,1234.26,SPEAKER_00, I just worry about her because she just doesn't have any people.
1234.26,1238.26,SPEAKER_00, I think you kind of have the people contact to keep your interest.
1238.26,1246.26,SPEAKER_00, I don't think I think she'll just be you know like her heartels to stop kind of which would be a nice way to go but it'll just be more from.
1246.26,1252.26,SPEAKER_00, I don't know you know not losing the will to live kind of you know not really wanting to die but just not really have anything to live for.
1252.26,1260.26,SPEAKER_02, Well you know she says a thing about feeling needed and I'm a so guilty that I didn't need her this summer to don't you know we don't.
1260.26,1282.26,SPEAKER_02, You know you know and but I still be it would you know if she wants like I think her next summer I won't have any classes to take home fully and we get her up here and I can do things with her I'll take her to the outlet mall to yeah you know I'll just think of some things you know maybe we could do a little house cleaning in the morning and then think of someplace to go or do in the afternoon or even if she would just I don't know.
1282.26,1285.26,SPEAKER_02, I mean I like to work in the yard.
1285.26,1288.26,SPEAKER_02, Yeah and I don't know if she probably wouldn't really like to work tonight.
1288.26,1305.26,SPEAKER_00, Some of that too I was so you know the days that I was off I would go run and then I wanted to spend and sometimes she would kind of come outside and smoke her cigarette and and then she would be like oh yeah she could have just come out and you know because I planted flowers and did some of that stuff when she was here and you know but she didn't
1305.26,1332.26,SPEAKER_02, really just I mean I enjoyed it every night after he comes home we eat dinner and clean up and then we usually go out in the yard because it's cool then yeah and we usually walk around and you know we'll see a place that needs to be weeded so we'll stop and pull the weeds and talk you know and then we'll walk you know we we've peruse the entire perimeter area and then we'll check the tomatoes and like a couple nights ago we put miracle grow on the flowers and it's just a nice you know what I'm saying yeah it's cool and it's pretty outside and the stuff needs to be done.
1332.26,1361.26,SPEAKER_02, And then we usually end up getting a popsicle or something and we sit on the front porch swing for a while it's just so pleasant and nice outside it to me it's just a real pleasant way to spend the evening and you get and you get a little bit of everything done around the yard so it doesn't become completely overgrown with weeds and stuff and you know I mean I would be perfectly willing just to do stuff like that with mother just to do things around and talk and you know enjoy each other's company while we're doing that but it's like look you said you give her project and then she's like well I can't do that.
1361.26,1363.26,SPEAKER_00, Yeah I was so weird.
1363.26,1373.26,SPEAKER_00, I just I just do in my windows I kind of started before I called you and she did like those four big ones you know in the evening area there and that was a good idea.
1373.26,1384.26,SPEAKER_00, So I'm just lazy I just didn't want to do anymore and it's like okay but I mean I already did it took five minutes I mean I literally to do I mean that was it you know that was all that she had the
1384.26,1388.26,SPEAKER_02, energy to do. God felt a thing he's been around here now that I'm done with school.
1388.26,1396.26,SPEAKER_02, It's just I thought about your project and I think God has placed such a pet I mean that basement I'm afraid even look at it.
1396.26,1407.26,SPEAKER_00, Yeah that's not my pretty well straightened up and I say there's more of Ted's crap and I didn't think he had much stuff and I said the thing that's so annoying is like he had all this crap on his shelf and his master bedroom bedroom in the apartment.
1407.26,1410.26,SPEAKER_00, Yeah they had like this old this little tiny portable black and white TV and stuff.
1410.26,1412.26,SPEAKER_00, When would you ever use that?
1412.26,1413.26,SPEAKER_02, Oh well submit you're the same way.
1413.26,1415.26,SPEAKER_02, You know he got stuff from centuries ago.
1415.26,1421.26,SPEAKER_00, And he had kind of like if it's something expensive or if it was expensive but he thought it he doesn't want to throw it away.
1421.26,1422.26,SPEAKER_00, Right.
1422.26,1427.26,SPEAKER_00, And then he brought this it's like a leather golf bag but it's got to be 20 or 30 years old and it's all beat up.
1427.26,1434.26,SPEAKER_00, Yeah I mean it is leather and I'm sure it was very expensive and so without the garage and so he'd set it out there.
1434.26,1443.26,SPEAKER_00, And when he first did it it was like trash day and he'd set it kind of by the trash can so I called him my clay I called him and I said you know do you want me to eat?
1443.26,1447.26,SPEAKER_00, Because he puts the trash out and I said you want me to put that golf bag out with the trash you forgot to put that in.
1447.26,1448.26,SPEAKER_00, No.
1448.26,1453.26,SPEAKER_00, I don't know I don't know that that's why he said that they're saying I'm going to put my class as you are and it's real heavy and stuff.
1453.26,1454.26,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1454.26,1459.26,SPEAKER_00, So I never walk anymore I was riding a car and I said that's a really expensive golf bag and I said but it's old and it's all beat up.
1459.26,1461.26,SPEAKER_00, Stuff is it no I'm going to use it don't throw it away.
1461.26,1462.26,SPEAKER_00, I said okay.
1462.26,1463.26,SPEAKER_00, Well of course it's set there.
1463.26,1468.26,SPEAKER_00, Oh yeah the whole time so I finally just moved it down into the basement you know but it's like why would you keep that?
1468.26,1478.26,SPEAKER_00, I mean because you just can't stand because he's not he paid I don't know what I'm probably a couple hundred dollars for a way back when or something you know and it's just like it looks like shit I would be embarrassed to use it.
1478.26,1483.26,SPEAKER_00, I don't think anybody would ever notice it it's real leather or then a cost of money it just looks like an old ride.
1483.26,1484.26,SPEAKER_00, That bag you know.
1484.26,1485.26,SPEAKER_00, Exactly.
1485.26,1486.26,SPEAKER_00, Exactly.
1486.26,1495.26,SPEAKER_00, And I put that down in the basement I moved it out yeah and I'm that box with that TV and all that shit and that he's never ever open that or look at that stuff you know and.
1495.26,1505.26,SPEAKER_02, Well see Mitch has stuff down there that when they when he's and died and they cleaned it all out and he just moved it all but he has never gone through it that's what happened that stuff is.
1505.26,1506.26,SPEAKER_01, Oh no.
1506.26,1507.26,SPEAKER_02, And see I can understand.
1507.26,1513.26,SPEAKER_02, I'd like to just say it a lot for the trash but I can understand there may be things of her in there he wanted me.
1513.26,1530.26,SPEAKER_02, Yeah but my lord I mean she said did for almost 10 years yeah you know let's go through it and figure out well the neighborhood is having a garage sale September 9th and I think maybe maybe that would motivate me to do all this stuff and then I thought and maybe it would make some money for Christmas too because.
1530.26,1537.26,SPEAKER_02, I'm thrilled that they're eliminating that interest but it was like a check for three hundred and fifty dollars yeah if it was a separate check.
1537.26,1538.26,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1538.26,1541.26,SPEAKER_02, That's why they could eliminate it and.
1541.26,1552.26,SPEAKER_02, And I was you know that help pay for Christmas yeah and things are going to be tied anyway so I thought well maybe if I got because I could sell show is old furniture you know there's some big things in there right that we could get rid of.
1552.26,1557.26,SPEAKER_02, It's a lot for yeah it's a book and maybe that would help supplement Christmas a little bit well.
1557.26,1558.26,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1558.26,1570.26,SPEAKER_02, But anyway that's going to be a whole other thing to share God with you know me having to send four hundred twenty five dollars a month stasis way right yeah that can anyway.
1570.26,1580.26,SPEAKER_02, I should get my raise and I figure all sub a class a day or so that that brings in some money that's the most something in the world to do but.
1580.26,1587.26,SPEAKER_00, It's doable yes does bring the money be prepared for them to cut a socks and chummy oh okay.
1587.26,1593.26,SPEAKER_02, I say she'll bust in and say we have to hang up okay well I could always call you back or for in the middle of anything.
1593.26,1595.26,SPEAKER_02, Yes big we are but.
1595.26,1603.26,SPEAKER_02, It's just sleeping downstairs well the girls have never cut they can't they came in and out in and out last night started we went to bed ten thirty.
1603.26,1609.26,SPEAKER_02, And it started about eleven thirty and I mean they were in the phone is ringing they were out and I finally said I mean Mitch was like ready to get a gun.
1609.26,1620.26,SPEAKER_02, Yeah and and so I finally got out and it's a second moment in shell and Dana came in and they said we're all laughing and talking and I went out there and I said you guys this is it we can't sleep you know.

1650.26,1657.26,SPEAKER_02, I know but you know it's a phone ringing and all that I mean it's just it's just enough to drive you crazy.
1657.26,1662.26,SPEAKER_02, And then oh Misty has her final organic mystery.

1684.26,1687.26,SPEAKER_00, Yeah and she was working some little town or blah blah.
