0.00,7.00,SPEAKER_00, It makes a weird noise.
7.00,12.00,SPEAKER_01, You can hear that?
12.00,15.00,SPEAKER_00, I thought it was in the monsters.
15.00,20.00,SPEAKER_00," Can't be playing wrong, maybe I'm a getch."
20.00,21.00,SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh.
21.00,22.00,SPEAKER_00, There.
22.00,23.00,SPEAKER_01, I understand.
23.00,24.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm saying.
24.00,26.00,SPEAKER_00, So what it is.
26.00,29.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, Helen, I friend of mine."
29.00,30.00,SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh.
30.00,31.00,SPEAKER_01, I friend of Susan.
31.00,32.00,SPEAKER_00, Uh-huh.
32.00,33.00,SPEAKER_01, Might sell.
33.00,36.00,SPEAKER_01, She has old United Mileage.
36.00,37.00,SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh.
37.00,38.00,SPEAKER_01, And you can use it anytime.
38.00,39.00,SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh.
39.00,40.00,SPEAKER_01, Anywhere.
40.00,41.00,SPEAKER_00, Uh-huh.
41.00,50.00,SPEAKER_01, So she is willing to sell me a ticket to Milan for $900.
50.00,51.00,SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh.
51.00,53.00,SPEAKER_01, And she might do the same for you.
53.00,54.00,SPEAKER_01, I have faith.
54.00,56.00,SPEAKER_00, That's her best price.
56.00,57.00,SPEAKER_00, Yep.
57.00,58.00,SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh.
58.00,59.00,, Uh-huh.
59.00,60.00,, Uh-huh.
60.00,61.00,SPEAKER_00, Uh-huh.
61.00,64.00,SPEAKER_00, Cause I have to take it going.
64.00,65.00,SPEAKER_01, Tell me.
65.00,66.00,SPEAKER_01, You have to go.
66.00,67.00,SPEAKER_01, Um-huh.
67.00,68.00,SPEAKER_01, Going from here.
68.00,69.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
69.00,70.00,SPEAKER_00, On the 17th.
70.00,71.00,SPEAKER_01, On.
71.00,72.00,, On the American.
72.00,73.00,SPEAKER_00, Um-
73.00,77.00,SPEAKER_01, The problem is I can't come back.
77.00,78.00,SPEAKER_00, Exactly.
78.00,79.00,SPEAKER_01, That.
79.00,80.00,SPEAKER_00, Exactly.
80.00,82.00,SPEAKER_01, Until like the end of August.
82.00,87.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, they have the 17th, 16th of August."
87.00,88.00,SPEAKER_01, Right.
88.00,96.00,SPEAKER_00," First time. However, uh- one can get back by standing back."
96.00,97.00,SPEAKER_01, Oh my god.
97.00,98.00,SPEAKER_00, Uh-huh.
98.00,102.00,SPEAKER_00," You know, which is, you know, you may not get on one day."
102.00,105.00,SPEAKER_00, But there are a lot of flights.
105.00,110.00,SPEAKER_00," And uh- rarely, you know, are they always for?"
110.00,113.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, I have to go."
113.00,114.00,SPEAKER_01, Uh-
114.00,115.00,SPEAKER_00, What price?
115.00,116.00,SPEAKER_01, Uh-
116.00,118.00,SPEAKER_00," Which is from bed, I guess."
118.00,121.00,SPEAKER_01, Wow. But what about you?
121.00,124.00,SPEAKER_00, Uh- Then I'll work on me.
124.00,132.00,SPEAKER_00," Uh- Cause if I don't, if I don't get back, like next week, it's no big deal."
132.00,133.00,SPEAKER_00, I could just stay here.
133.00,135.00,SPEAKER_00, So it's not important for me.
135.00,136.00,SPEAKER_01, Right.
136.00,140.00,SPEAKER_00," You see, so the main thing is to get your deal."
140.00,142.00,SPEAKER_01, So you might not come back here.
142.00,143.00,SPEAKER_01, Right.
143.00,144.00,SPEAKER_00, Gotcha.
144.00,147.00,SPEAKER_00, So I'm only going to be there for like three or four days.
147.00,148.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
148.00,151.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, if it's going to cost me an arm, a lady, just cheaper."
151.00,152.00,SPEAKER_00, If I just stay here.
152.00,153.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
153.00,156.00,SPEAKER_00, So you don't have to do anything to work that way.
156.00,157.00,SPEAKER_01, Right.
157.00,159.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, what happens to your work?"
159.00,161.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, I just want to do it."
161.00,170.00,SPEAKER_00," But I mean, if I have to pay, you know, a thousand dollars, it's not expeditious to make a thousand dollars."
170.00,171.00,SPEAKER_01, It's a big word.
171.00,174.00,SPEAKER_01, A lot of words are making you use big words.
174.00,176.00,SPEAKER_00, Is that what it is?
176.00,177.00,SPEAKER_00, Get in beta.
177.00,178.00,SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh.
178.00,180.00,SPEAKER_00, That's the purpose.
180.00,181.00,SPEAKER_00, Uh-huh.
181.00,184.00,SPEAKER_00, Pretty sure word power.
184.00,192.00,SPEAKER_00," So, you know, that would be the thing."
192.00,200.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, there's no way I'm sure you're not going to get back, you know, within a day or two of the time."
200.00,207.00,SPEAKER_00," You know, because there are 1800 flights that they go back."
207.00,209.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, not an American."
209.00,210.00,SPEAKER_00, On American.
210.00,211.00,SPEAKER_00, On American.
211.00,213.00,, They go from London.
213.00,217.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, this is a flight to London."
217.00,218.00,SPEAKER_01, Right.
218.00,219.00,SPEAKER_01, Right.
219.00,223.00,SPEAKER_00, And then I just get the connect and flight.
223.00,226.00,SPEAKER_00, Can you get me a connecting flight?
226.00,229.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, that shouldn't be a problem."
229.00,232.00,SPEAKER_01, Susan said there's no inner Europe flight.
232.00,233.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
233.00,234.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
234.00,237.00,SPEAKER_00, Now I can go down to the plate here and...
237.00,238.00,SPEAKER_00, Sure.
238.00,239.00,SPEAKER_00, Sure.
239.00,240.00,SPEAKER_00, Sure.
240.00,244.00,SPEAKER_00," Now, there's nothing possible with Susan."
244.00,250.00,SPEAKER_00, Nobody who doesn't have a ticket a month ago is not going to plow up the rest of the year.
250.00,253.00,SPEAKER_01," So, you don't want to take it to Milan for $900?"
253.00,255.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, again, that's the point."
255.00,265.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, if it's going to cost that, it's easier for me just to get yours than not do"
265.00,266.00,SPEAKER_02, one.
266.00,267.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
267.00,268.00,SPEAKER_01, You see?
268.00,270.00,, Uh-uh. I'm just...
270.00,271.00,SPEAKER_00, I'm just...
271.00,272.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm just...
272.00,273.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm just...
273.00,274.00,SPEAKER_00, Excuse me.
274.00,284.00,SPEAKER_00," I see, you know, it just depends only if you would just like to, you know, just stay and buy that stuff."
284.00,288.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, and I have to stand by and lend them by myself."
288.00,289.00,SPEAKER_00, Uh-huh.
289.00,292.00,SPEAKER_00, Like the big girl.
292.00,293.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
293.00,294.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
294.00,296.00,SPEAKER_00, See if you can back.
296.00,297.00,SPEAKER_00, Very exact.
297.00,298.00,SPEAKER_00, Very exact.
298.00,299.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
299.00,302.00,SPEAKER_02, That's the thing.
302.00,311.00,SPEAKER_00," You know, just pick a day, you know, like probably that Tuesday."
311.00,317.00,SPEAKER_00, Like the first of August would be the best time.
317.00,318.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
318.00,321.00,SPEAKER_00," Um, mind is sometimes people coming back."
321.00,324.00,SPEAKER_00," But, you know, nobody leaves on Tuesdays."
324.00,328.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, do you think it would be better to come like on that Friday, the 21st?"
328.00,331.00,SPEAKER_01, And then that'd be closer to the middle of August anyways?
331.00,337.00,SPEAKER_00," Uh, well, I mean, that's something that's something you could do."
337.00,340.00,SPEAKER_00," Uh, you know, that's not coming anyway."
340.00,341.00,SPEAKER_01," Then, right."
341.00,345.00,SPEAKER_01," I don't have to fly with you, so I could just come that Friday."
345.00,346.00,SPEAKER_01, Right.
346.00,354.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, the other thing is that you could just stay longer."
354.00,355.00,SPEAKER_02, Right.
355.00,356.00,SPEAKER_02, Exactly.
356.00,357.00,SPEAKER_00, Get a short flight.
357.00,359.00,SPEAKER_00, Just stay longer.
359.00,360.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, yeah."
360.00,365.00,SPEAKER_01," But, maybe you came like the 21st."
365.00,370.00,SPEAKER_00," Uh, it would be, uh, a little over three weeks."
370.00,371.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
371.00,377.00,SPEAKER_01," I think I should go back to work, but I think it would be better if I came on the 21st that way then."
377.00,378.00,SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh.
378.00,379.00,SPEAKER_01, If you can change it.
379.00,382.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, I can probably change it."
382.00,396.00,SPEAKER_01," Because that way, I'll be closer to the middle of August and hopefully if there's, when the the problems arise with David's deal, I'm not going to even say if."
396.00,403.00,SPEAKER_01," Um, I can resolve it from here and I have it ruined my vacation."
403.00,404.00,SPEAKER_01, All right.
404.00,405.00,SPEAKER_00, So that's true.
405.00,408.00,SPEAKER_01," You know, I'd rather not have to be doing that, craving it."
408.00,410.00,SPEAKER_01, And I'd still be there for...
410.00,412.00,SPEAKER_01, Be-be-kinging out of James.
412.00,414.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh."
414.00,415.00,SPEAKER_00, Be your baby.
415.00,416.00,SPEAKER_01, What?
416.00,418.00,SPEAKER_00, What day are they here?
418.00,419.00,SPEAKER_00, Hold on.
419.00,421.00,SPEAKER_01, You don't have the paper?
421.00,422.00,SPEAKER_00, I know I got it.
422.00,423.00,SPEAKER_00, I know.
423.00,425.00,SPEAKER_00, Be-be-be-being of the 23rd.
425.00,428.00,SPEAKER_00," So yeah, you get here the 22nd."
428.00,430.00,SPEAKER_00, It's true.
430.00,436.00,SPEAKER_01," Um, you know, and if they didn't have room on the 21st, I could come this one in a few days."
436.00,438.00,SPEAKER_01, By myself a few days.
438.00,439.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
439.00,440.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
440.00,441.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
441.00,446.00,SPEAKER_01," Um, where was that paper, by the way?"
446.00,447.00,SPEAKER_00, Which paper?
447.00,448.00,SPEAKER_00, A paper that...
448.00,450.00,SPEAKER_00, I can't put a pour you and gave it to you.
450.00,452.00,SPEAKER_01," No, no, I mean, where was it when you told me I had it?"
452.00,453.00,SPEAKER_01, My choice that you had it.
453.00,454.00,SPEAKER_01, Who had it?
454.00,455.00,SPEAKER_00, I don't know.
455.00,456.00,SPEAKER_00, I don't know.
456.00,457.00,SPEAKER_01, Where did you come from?
457.00,458.00,SPEAKER_01, It's pretty detective.
458.00,461.00,SPEAKER_00, The important thing is that we have it.
461.00,464.00,SPEAKER_02, I want to be able to say I told you so.
464.00,465.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, no, I'm sorry."
465.00,466.00,SPEAKER_00," No, that's okay."
466.00,470.00,SPEAKER_00, I know that we're all that's supposed to pour the paint in your life.
470.00,471.00,SPEAKER_00, Yes.
471.00,474.00,SPEAKER_00," No, I know that very well."
474.00,475.00,SPEAKER_00, Yes.
475.00,477.00,SPEAKER_00, Just not happy to have it.
477.00,480.00,SPEAKER_00, I've got to get some justice.
480.00,484.00,SPEAKER_00," I told you, don't you?"
484.00,487.00,SPEAKER_00," No, I know the program."
487.00,488.00,SPEAKER_00, It's tough.
488.00,490.00,SPEAKER_00, It's tough.
490.00,496.00,SPEAKER_00, So what I'll do then is then I'll go ahead and get it then.
496.00,497.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
497.00,498.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, you have been running."
498.00,499.00,SPEAKER_01, I can stand by.
499.00,501.00,SPEAKER_01, Let go get a hotel if I have to.
501.00,502.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, I'll have to run by then."
502.00,503.00,SPEAKER_01, That's right.
503.00,504.00,SPEAKER_01, Everybody will have stuff by then.
504.00,507.00,SPEAKER_00, That won't be a problem.
507.00,510.00,SPEAKER_00, That won't be a problem.
510.00,513.00,SPEAKER_00, That won't be a problem.
513.00,523.00,SPEAKER_00, The 16th you'd have to stay over in Boston anyway if you did that.
523.00,529.00,SPEAKER_00," But again, that's not, see, that one wasn't even available the last time I called."
529.00,530.00,SPEAKER_01, Right.
530.00,533.00,SPEAKER_00, They say called because people do counsel.
533.00,534.00,SPEAKER_01, Right.
534.00,539.00,SPEAKER_00," So, you know, during the time we're just called on the daily basis."
539.00,540.00,SPEAKER_00, Sure.
540.00,541.00,SPEAKER_01, Change it.
541.00,542.00,SPEAKER_00, That's groovy.
542.00,543.00,SPEAKER_01, It's not a problem.
543.00,544.00,SPEAKER_00, I'm excited.
544.00,550.00,SPEAKER_00, The only problem will be the ticket to get the London.
550.00,557.00,SPEAKER_00, But I'll see if we can get a one way and then buy another one way going back.
557.00,558.00,SPEAKER_01, Where is this ticket?
558.00,560.00,SPEAKER_01, It was taking a terminal on.
560.00,564.00,SPEAKER_00," No, get it to knees from London to knees."
564.00,565.00,SPEAKER_01, Right.
565.00,566.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
566.00,570.00,SPEAKER_01," No, I mean coming when I leave LA the word or I fly to London."
570.00,571.00,SPEAKER_00, London.
571.00,572.00,, Yeah.
572.00,579.00,SPEAKER_01," And then I'll have to take a boat because there's no, no inter Europe, of course."
579.00,580.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
580.00,581.00,SPEAKER_00, Exactly.
581.00,582.00,SPEAKER_00, All the people in Europe are paralyzed.
582.00,583.00,SPEAKER_01, No.
583.00,584.00,SPEAKER_00," No, it's great."
584.00,587.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, let me know."
587.00,591.00,SPEAKER_00, I'll go ahead and do it.
591.00,592.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
592.00,597.00,SPEAKER_00, And I'll go and talk to the person here because they get cheap tickets.
597.00,599.00,SPEAKER_00, London and these.
599.00,601.00,SPEAKER_01, Is Neil still there?
601.00,602.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
602.00,603.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
603.00,604.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
604.00,605.00,SPEAKER_00, It's like.
605.00,606.00,SPEAKER_00, He's never going home.
606.00,608.00,SPEAKER_01, Let's see.
608.00,610.00,SPEAKER_00, Saturday.
610.00,611.00,SPEAKER_00, Saturday.
611.00,612.00,SPEAKER_00, Saturday.
612.00,613.00,SPEAKER_00, We went out to dinner with.
613.00,614.00,, Georgia.
614.00,615.00,," Oh, but night."
615.00,616.00,SPEAKER_00, Uh huh.
616.00,617.00,SPEAKER_00, And.
617.00,618.00,SPEAKER_00, Uh huh.
618.00,619.00,SPEAKER_00, Got a really good meal.
619.00,622.00,SPEAKER_00, We'll go there again when I do come.
622.00,623.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
623.00,624.00,SPEAKER_00, But really good restaurant.
624.00,627.00,SPEAKER_00, They were people who went to the jazz festival with me.
627.00,630.00,SPEAKER_00," Like, I was like, I'm a little bit nervous."
630.00,631.00,SPEAKER_00, I'm a little bit nervous.
631.00,632.00,SPEAKER_00, I'm a little bit nervous.
632.00,633.00,SPEAKER_00, I'm a little bit nervous.
633.00,635.00,SPEAKER_00, But who went to the jazz festival with me?
635.00,637.00,SPEAKER_00," Like, they're on the rest."
637.00,639.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, sure."
639.00,642.00,SPEAKER_00," So, Bill, probably want to go with this fish here."
642.00,643.00,SPEAKER_01, That's fine.
643.00,645.00,SPEAKER_00, Nice Pete.
645.00,647.00,SPEAKER_01, Cool.
647.00,648.00,SPEAKER_00, Cool.
648.00,649.00,SPEAKER_01, Cool.
649.00,650.00,SPEAKER_00, Cool.
650.00,651.00,SPEAKER_00, Cool.
651.00,652.00,SPEAKER_00, Good.
652.00,653.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
653.00,654.00,SPEAKER_00," So, have any of your things closed?"
654.00,655.00,SPEAKER_00, No.
655.00,656.00,SPEAKER_01, Nothing.
656.00,657.00,SPEAKER_00, Nothing.
657.00,660.00,SPEAKER_01, I just had a nice dream though that David's.
660.00,663.00,SPEAKER_01, It was just fine.
663.00,664.00,SPEAKER_00, Uh huh.
664.00,667.00,SPEAKER_01, Did he got his money yesterday like he supposed to?
667.00,668.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
668.00,669.00,SPEAKER_00, That was a dream.
669.00,672.00,SPEAKER_00," So, he still hasn't made any inroads?"
672.00,673.00,SPEAKER_00, Uh huh.
673.00,674.00,SPEAKER_01, Not him.
674.00,677.00,SPEAKER_01, He's having trouble closing the station.
677.00,678.00,SPEAKER_00, Uh huh.
678.00,680.00,SPEAKER_00, It may not happen.
680.00,681.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, God."
681.00,682.00,SPEAKER_00, Sure.
682.00,686.00,SPEAKER_00, That I'm happy to hear from his first five.
686.00,687.00,SPEAKER_00, The station?
687.00,688.00,SPEAKER_01, Right.
688.00,689.00,SPEAKER_01, Right.
689.00,692.00,SPEAKER_00, If he doesn't get the station?
692.00,693.00,SPEAKER_01, Probably.
693.00,695.00,SPEAKER_00," No, come back to us, uh."
695.00,697.00,SPEAKER_01, He'll be in bad shape.
697.00,702.00,SPEAKER_01," And then this, because everybody involved will get sued."
702.00,704.00,SPEAKER_00, Pretty mean.
704.00,708.00,SPEAKER_00," Everybody involved, does that mean sure or plan?"
708.00,709.00,SPEAKER_01, Probably.
709.00,710.00,SPEAKER_00, Why?
710.00,715.00,SPEAKER_01," I don't think they can, but I think they'll try."
715.00,718.00,SPEAKER_01," I mean, you know how people are?"
718.00,721.00,SPEAKER_00, I know how people are.
721.00,722.00,, That's...
722.00,723.00,SPEAKER_00, That's...
723.00,724.00,SPEAKER_01, That's...
724.00,726.00,SPEAKER_01," If it's ugly, all right."
726.00,727.00,SPEAKER_01, Big time.
727.00,730.00,SPEAKER_00, That's hope that doesn't happen.
730.00,731.00,SPEAKER_00, I know.
731.00,734.00,SPEAKER_00, That really don't thank you.
734.00,740.00,SPEAKER_00," Unfortunately, that the boy has a little bit BS."
740.00,741.00,SPEAKER_01, Yep.
741.00,744.00,SPEAKER_00," Sorry, have BS when you're produced, but..."
744.00,748.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, it's all right to have BS if you don't hurt other people."
748.00,749.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
749.00,752.00,SPEAKER_01," And if all other people in it, we can sit all day and listen to this..."
752.00,754.00,SPEAKER_01," And not, type three."
754.00,755.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
755.00,756.00,SPEAKER_01, Right.
756.00,763.00,SPEAKER_01," Now, I'm in it, and two people who've owned their house and moved everything out and done their instinct they need to and had off the market for almost two months."
763.00,764.00,SPEAKER_00, Uh-huh.
764.00,765.00,SPEAKER_01, You know.
765.00,766.00,SPEAKER_01, It's a problem.
766.00,767.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
767.00,768.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, that's..."
768.00,769.00,SPEAKER_00, That's bad.
769.00,770.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
770.00,771.00,SPEAKER_00, Hm.
771.00,772.00,SPEAKER_00," Agree, I agree."
772.00,773.00,," No, sure."
773.00,774.00,SPEAKER_00, No.
774.00,775.00,SPEAKER_00," No, sure."
775.00,776.00,SPEAKER_01, No.
776.00,777.00,SPEAKER_00, No.
777.00,778.00,SPEAKER_00, No.
778.00,779.00,, No.
779.00,785.00,SPEAKER_00," You know, to get this ticket, I need to get them money."
785.00,786.00,SPEAKER_00, Let's see.
786.00,787.00,SPEAKER_01, Who?
787.00,788.00,SPEAKER_00, Uh-huh.
788.00,789.00,SPEAKER_00, America.
789.00,791.00,SPEAKER_01, But you say it was free.
791.00,792.00,SPEAKER_00," No, it is."
792.00,795.00,SPEAKER_00," But to get it faster, we don't have 21 days."
795.00,796.00,SPEAKER_00," Uh, expertise."
796.00,803.00,SPEAKER_00," Uh, expertise service for business pays, go to those syndication on the check."
803.00,804.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
804.00,805.00,SPEAKER_00, Let me give you a number.
805.00,806.00,SPEAKER_01, Wait.
806.00,809.00,SPEAKER_01," Let me get it right in you, Tim."
809.00,810.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, right."
810.00,813.00,SPEAKER_01, You can have those or in this house.
813.00,814.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
814.00,815.00,SPEAKER_01, Hahaha.
815.00,817.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, that's it."
817.00,818.00,, Yeah.
818.00,819.00,, Okay.
819.00,820.00,," Uh, that's the..."
820.00,822.00,, Don't worry about it.
822.00,823.00,, I'll have them.
823.00,824.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
824.00,825.00,SPEAKER_00, That's the old.
825.00,826.00,SPEAKER_00, Don't worry about it.
826.00,827.00,SPEAKER_00, I'll fax it to you.
827.00,828.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, what?"
828.00,836.00,SPEAKER_00, That's what I'll fax it to you because what I'll have to do is give you the flight numbers anyway.
836.00,837.00,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
837.00,842.00,SPEAKER_00," Uh, but it's for."
842.00,845.00,SPEAKER_00, And then you just sent them a...
845.00,846.00,SPEAKER_00, Money order.
846.00,847.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
847.00,848.00,SPEAKER_01, For how much money?
848.00,849.00,SPEAKER_01, 40 dollars.
849.00,850.00,SPEAKER_00, Oh.
850.00,851.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
851.00,857.00,SPEAKER_00, It's just the charge for getting it faster than the 21 days.
857.00,858.00,SPEAKER_01, Got it.
858.00,862.00,SPEAKER_00, That's the way they're getting them for days.
862.00,863.00,, That'll work.
863.00,864.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
864.00,865.00,SPEAKER_01, Very good.
865.00,868.00,SPEAKER_00, So any other things closed?
868.00,869.00,SPEAKER_00, Nothing else closed?
869.00,871.00,SPEAKER_00, Nothing's closed at all.
871.00,872.00,SPEAKER_01, I hope you're...
872.00,873.00,SPEAKER_01, I've just spoken to Bernice.
873.00,874.00,, I spoke to Bernice.
874.00,877.00,SPEAKER_00," I told her, um, blah, blah, blah."
877.00,878.00,SPEAKER_00, About the thing.
878.00,879.00,SPEAKER_00, A lot of phone things.
879.00,880.00,SPEAKER_01, Good.
880.00,881.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm just so busy.
881.00,882.00,SPEAKER_01, I didn't...
882.00,883.00,SPEAKER_01, Why?
883.00,885.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm just not a priority.
885.00,888.00,SPEAKER_01, Not a priority.
888.00,889.00,, Not any of.
889.00,892.00,SPEAKER_01," And I said, well, Bernice, it's just for saving money."
892.00,893.00,," And blah, blah, blah."
893.00,894.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm not sure.
894.00,895.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm not sure.
895.00,896.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm not sure.
896.00,897.00,SPEAKER_00, I'm not sure.
897.00,898.00,SPEAKER_00, I'm not sure.
898.00,901.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, Bernice, it's just for saving money."
901.00,904.00,SPEAKER_01," And blah, blah, blah."
904.00,907.00,SPEAKER_01, And there's nothing wrong with me at all.
907.00,908.00,SPEAKER_01, At all.
908.00,909.00,, At all.
909.00,910.00,SPEAKER_00, That's good.
910.00,911.00,SPEAKER_01, That's good.
911.00,912.00,SPEAKER_00, That's good.
912.00,913.00,SPEAKER_00, That's a good way.
913.00,914.00,SPEAKER_01, That's a good way.
914.00,915.00,SPEAKER_00, That's a good way.
915.00,916.00,SPEAKER_00, That's a good way.
916.00,917.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
917.00,918.00,SPEAKER_01, Hmm.
918.00,919.00,SPEAKER_00, Strange.
919.00,920.00,SPEAKER_00," It was strange, huh?"
920.00,922.00,SPEAKER_01, That's very strange.
922.00,923.00,SPEAKER_00, Hmm.
923.00,925.00,SPEAKER_00, Because it's got to be good.
925.00,926.00,, I'm not seeing you.
926.00,927.00,SPEAKER_00, Uh-huh.
927.00,930.00,SPEAKER_00, You're a messie here.
930.00,931.00,SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh.
931.00,932.00,SPEAKER_00, It will be.
932.00,933.00,SPEAKER_01, All right.
933.00,934.00,SPEAKER_00, That's amazing.
934.00,937.00,SPEAKER_00, Isn't that weird?
937.00,939.00,SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh.
939.00,945.00,SPEAKER_00," Like, it's something that one person noticed, not other than that."
945.00,948.00,SPEAKER_00, And it's really reality.
948.00,949.00,, Right.
949.00,951.00,SPEAKER_01, And that's what the lady said to me.
951.00,952.00,SPEAKER_01, I didn't mean to be paranoid and I thought.
952.00,956.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, but with just me, be my usual self, I can say yes."
956.00,957.00,SPEAKER_01, Take back.
957.00,960.00,SPEAKER_00," Take back, fight."
960.00,961.00,SPEAKER_00," Take back, fight."
961.00,964.00,SPEAKER_01," But not with the dark thing, yes."
964.00,965.00,SPEAKER_00, Why are you strange?
965.00,966.00,SPEAKER_00, Why are you strange?
966.00,967.00,," Well, that's good."
967.00,968.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
968.00,969.00,SPEAKER_00, Thank you.
969.00,970.00,SPEAKER_01, I was just smart.
970.00,971.00,SPEAKER_00, Everything else is smooth.
971.00,979.00,SPEAKER_01," So, I got a little sick again."
979.00,980.00,SPEAKER_00, Uh-huh.
980.00,981.00,SPEAKER_01, But it went away.
981.00,982.00,SPEAKER_01," Very good, right?"
982.00,983.00,SPEAKER_00, I get sick from yoga.
983.00,984.00,SPEAKER_01, What?
984.00,990.00,SPEAKER_00, That's because you do it like everything else too much.
990.00,995.00,SPEAKER_01," No, I don't know that it doesn't feel like it's too much time I do it."
995.00,997.00,SPEAKER_00," See, playing, you do every day."
997.00,999.00,SPEAKER_00, I didn't do it every day.
999.00,1001.00,SPEAKER_01, I don't do it every day.
1001.00,1003.00,SPEAKER_01, Three times a week.
1003.00,1004.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
1004.00,1005.00,SPEAKER_01, Really?
1005.00,1006.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
1006.00,1007.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, that's not too much."
1007.00,1008.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
1008.00,1012.00,SPEAKER_01, Three or four times a week.
1012.00,1013.00,SPEAKER_00, Here we go.
1013.00,1014.00,SPEAKER_00, Four times a week.
1014.00,1015.00,SPEAKER_01, Mostly three.
1015.00,1016.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
1016.00,1019.00,SPEAKER_01," No, but sometimes Jasmine is absent."
1019.00,1021.00,SPEAKER_01, And there was a different teacher.
1021.00,1023.00,SPEAKER_01, And this teacher was a little bit harder.
1023.00,1025.00,SPEAKER_01," And you have to do it, right?"
1025.00,1026.00,SPEAKER_01, I wouldn't.
1026.00,1029.00,SPEAKER_00, It didn't feel like it was that much harder.
1029.00,1032.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, but you know it is."
1032.00,1035.00,SPEAKER_00, But you say the same thing four times a month.
1035.00,1038.00,SPEAKER_00, I do not because I've only done this twice.
1038.00,1040.00,SPEAKER_00, Are you talking about how it's nice?
1040.00,1041.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1041.00,1042.00,SPEAKER_01, And that was the first time.
1042.00,1043.00,SPEAKER_00, And this is the second time.
1043.00,1044.00,SPEAKER_01, This is the second time.
1044.00,1045.00,SPEAKER_00, This is the second time.
1045.00,1047.00,SPEAKER_00, And tell me that next week.
1047.00,1049.00,SPEAKER_01, So that's not four times a month.
1049.00,1050.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
1050.00,1054.00,SPEAKER_00, But you know things are happening and then you go and do them anyway.
1054.00,1055.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, never mind."
1055.00,1056.00,SPEAKER_01, We're not anything.
1056.00,1057.00,SPEAKER_00, Third time.
1057.00,1058.00,SPEAKER_00, Third time.
1058.00,1059.00,SPEAKER_00, You didn't learn and have anything.
1059.00,1061.00,SPEAKER_00, If you keep doing the same thing.
1061.00,1064.00,SPEAKER_01, But I didn't really believe it was a yoga the first time.
1064.00,1065.00,SPEAKER_01, Now I know it is.
1065.00,1066.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
1066.00,1068.00,SPEAKER_00, But you knew it the last time you said it.
1068.00,1069.00,SPEAKER_01, No.
1069.00,1070.00,SPEAKER_01, Now I know.
1070.00,1071.00,SPEAKER_00, Tell me about it.
1071.00,1072.00,SPEAKER_01, And the jam.
1072.00,1073.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
1073.00,1078.00,SPEAKER_00, And when we have this conversation again you didn't know it was.
1078.00,1080.00,SPEAKER_01," No, we're not going to have this conversation again."
1080.00,1081.00,SPEAKER_00," No, we will."
1081.00,1082.00,SPEAKER_00," No, I'm right."
1082.00,1083.00,SPEAKER_01, They're down.
1083.00,1084.00,SPEAKER_01, So what else?
1084.00,1085.00,SPEAKER_00, That's for you.
1085.00,1086.00,SPEAKER_01," No, we can't stop talking."
1086.00,1087.00,SPEAKER_01, I've got to use it all now.
1087.00,1090.00,SPEAKER_00, It's been got 12 more minutes.
1090.00,1091.00,SPEAKER_01, Well more than that.
1091.00,1094.00,SPEAKER_00, So do you want to hear?
1094.00,1097.00,SPEAKER_00, I got 12 more minutes.
1097.00,1101.00,SPEAKER_01, So do you want to hear how I got?
1101.00,1102.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1102.00,1104.00,SPEAKER_01, I got as wide as a ghost.
1104.00,1105.00,SPEAKER_01, Why did you go?
1105.00,1108.00,SPEAKER_01, And then I just got sick of my stomach.
1108.00,1109.00,SPEAKER_01, After it.
1109.00,1111.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I got wide as a ghost."
1111.00,1115.00,SPEAKER_01, And then I ate and I got sick of my stomach.
1115.00,1116.00,SPEAKER_01, And that was it.
1116.00,1118.00,, That was all she wrote.
1118.00,1121.00,SPEAKER_01, The fluid was somewhere else.
1121.00,1123.00,SPEAKER_00, Were you standing on your head?
1123.00,1124.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1124.00,1125.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1125.00,1126.00,SPEAKER_00, That's probably yeah.
1126.00,1129.00,SPEAKER_01, But if you're standing on your head your blood goes to your head.
1129.00,1132.00,SPEAKER_00, So why would you be as wide as a ghost?
1132.00,1137.00,SPEAKER_01, Because I guess you're not in your lane.
1137.00,1141.00,SPEAKER_00, When you stand up with all the muscles you have in your lane.
1141.00,1148.00,SPEAKER_00, All fluid fluid there again.
1148.00,1153.00,SPEAKER_00, Have a big reservoir down there.
1153.00,1154.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
1154.00,1158.00,SPEAKER_01," People in my office even were looking at me and going, wow."
1158.00,1162.00,SPEAKER_01," You're really funny, come over."
1162.00,1169.00,SPEAKER_00, That old white before she hits the.
1169.00,1172.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1172.00,1173.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1173.00,1174.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1174.00,1179.00,SPEAKER_00, Now what do you think the possibility is a David and him?

1372.00,1375.00,SPEAKER_01, And you can only have it one time.
1375.00,1376.00,SPEAKER_00, Uh-huh.
1376.00,1380.00,SPEAKER_00, But how do you get new pin numbers for other people?
1380.00,1383.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, they have to send in these things."
1383.00,1384.00,SPEAKER_01, That she's pretty.
1384.00,1385.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, I'll ask it."
1385.00,1388.00,SPEAKER_00, And then they send it back with the Indians.

1411.00,1412.00,SPEAKER_01, Hmm.
1412.00,1413.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, she does."
1413.00,1415.00,SPEAKER_00," For the July, I slept all day."

1416.00,1419.00,SPEAKER_01, But I slept the whole day.

1430.00,1431.00,SPEAKER_01, No.
1431.00,1432.00,SPEAKER_01, You were going to tape the columbal.
1432.00,1433.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
1433.00,1438.00,SPEAKER_00, But there's no point in taping them if I've seen them.
1438.00,1440.00,SPEAKER_01," Uh, see, you've seen them all."
1440.00,1441.00,SPEAKER_01, Did some pieces of tape?
1441.00,1445.00,SPEAKER_00, Did you tape the jayest thing with muddy waters or something?
1445.00,1448.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, God."
1448.00,1449.00,SPEAKER_00, No.

1460.00,1461.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1461.00,1466.00,SPEAKER_00," Yep, it's only the important thing that we don't see."
1466.00,1470.00,SPEAKER_00, There were two things that were tabled.
1470.00,1471.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
1471.00,1472.00,SPEAKER_00, I was not the right.

1498.00,1501.00,SPEAKER_00, It's going to take me to the strong call.
1501.00,1506.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm going to think for a little crazy.
1506.00,1508.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, they would be right."
1508.00,1511.00,SPEAKER_01, They're the marquee.
1511.00,1514.00,SPEAKER_00, They would be right.
1514.00,1517.00,SPEAKER_01," And I'm going to listen to him, brow beat her."
1517.00,1518.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.

1521.00,1524.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, they're in good humor."
1524.00,1525.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1525.00,1527.00,SPEAKER_00, What about your computer?

1529.00,1530.00,SPEAKER_01, No.
1530.00,1531.00,SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh.
1531.00,1535.00,SPEAKER_01," I mean, it works, but my voice isn't working."
