0.00,2.00,SPEAKER_01, So there.
2.00,6.00,SPEAKER_01, And what exactly they're looking for as far as information goes.
6.00,15.00,SPEAKER_01," All I know is that it's got something to do with like, for me, I, you have to, since I speak English, you have to speak to somebody else to speak English."
15.00,21.00,SPEAKER_01," If you speak, you know, there's certain languages that are needed for the study."
21.00,25.00,SPEAKER_01," Like, I think you're a friend, and I don't remember all the other ones."
25.00,30.00,SPEAKER_01," If you speak that language, then you have to speak to someone, speak to saying language is you."
30.00,33.00,SPEAKER_01, To see if any of your diction of different stuff.
33.00,35.00,SPEAKER_01," I don't know how you, I'm not really sure."
35.00,37.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm not really sure exactly.
37.00,40.00,SPEAKER_02, Who's gonna be part of a discovery?
40.00,43.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, gosh."
43.00,45.00,SPEAKER_02, So how are you men? Pretty good.
45.00,47.00,SPEAKER_02, How about you?
47.00,48.00,SPEAKER_02," Busy, busy, busy."
48.00,50.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah. I took them to summer courses.
50.00,51.00,SPEAKER_02, I started in May.
51.00,54.00,SPEAKER_02," I took an English split for five weeks, and I took them."
54.00,56.00,SPEAKER_02," So I can show, here, I'm finishing up next week."
56.00,57.00,SPEAKER_02, I can't wait.
57.00,60.00,SPEAKER_02," So that psychology, introduction, psychology, yeah."
60.00,62.00,SPEAKER_02, Sociology is a lot of work.
62.00,64.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, what kind of sociology?"
64.00,66.00,SPEAKER_02, It's just general sociology.
66.00,67.00,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
67.00,70.00,SPEAKER_02," I have to record, write up, general write-ups and stuff."
70.00,72.00,SPEAKER_02, I grab articles on the paper.
72.00,73.00,SPEAKER_02, Bus specific topics.
73.00,76.00,SPEAKER_02, I have to write a paper handed in by the end of next week.
76.00,77.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
77.00,79.00,SPEAKER_02, There's a lot of digging information.
79.00,80.00,SPEAKER_02, I have to do with it.
80.00,82.00,SPEAKER_02," A lot of work to recycle, I just have to say the chapters."
82.00,83.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
83.00,85.00,SPEAKER_02," My tests, and I've got an A's on my test."
85.00,86.00,SPEAKER_02, Good.
86.00,87.00,SPEAKER_02, So I've got an A's for that.
87.00,89.00,SPEAKER_01, I know I hate research.
89.00,90.00,SPEAKER_01, It's hard.
90.00,91.00,SPEAKER_01, It's very hard.
91.00,93.00,SPEAKER_01, And it takes so much time.
93.00,94.00,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
94.00,96.00,SPEAKER_02, And I've been working up until like last week.
96.00,98.00,SPEAKER_02," I hurt my back, picking up Shanley."
98.00,99.00,SPEAKER_02," Seven, I worked the past two weeks."
99.00,100.00,SPEAKER_02, Are you kidding?
100.00,102.00,SPEAKER_02, So I'm going back Monday though.
102.00,103.00,SPEAKER_02, Thank goodness.
103.00,104.00,SPEAKER_02, Good.
104.00,105.00,SPEAKER_01, Good.
105.00,106.00,SPEAKER_01, Do you have to go through any physical therapy?
106.00,107.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, I'm doing it now."
107.00,108.00,SPEAKER_02, Good.
108.00,109.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
109.00,111.00,SPEAKER_02, I went last week and then I went three times this week.
111.00,112.00,SPEAKER_02," I said, Dr. Tomorrow."
112.00,118.00,SPEAKER_02, So I hope I'll get a note saying go back to work on Monday because I have no time to use for sick time and stuff.
118.00,122.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, because you took time when you had surgery in your knee too."
122.00,123.00,SPEAKER_02, Right.
123.00,124.00,SPEAKER_02, Exactly.
124.00,125.00,SPEAKER_02, I used to live up at that time.
125.00,126.00,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
126.00,128.00,SPEAKER_02, So I have none left whatsoever.
128.00,135.00,SPEAKER_02," I had to use it my last two vacation days because they had to make you do that now for some reason, which is fairly new, which really isn't fair."
135.00,138.00,SPEAKER_02, But what do you mean because you were out there?
138.00,145.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, well, I've been out all week and I said, I've only six times just seven hours and I said, what are you skimming the seven hours of sick and that eight hours of holiday?"
145.00,146.00,SPEAKER_02, So I have eight hours worth of pay.
146.00,147.00,SPEAKER_02, That's it.
147.00,148.00,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
148.00,149.00,SPEAKER_02," I said, don't use my vacation time."
149.00,150.00,SPEAKER_02, You told me she had to.
150.00,156.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, I had like two days left, like 16 hours, which was going to cover me for at least a couple of days in August."
156.00,158.00,SPEAKER_02, So I wouldn't like go without check.
158.00,159.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
159.00,164.00,SPEAKER_02," But they told me they had to pay me that 16 hours of vacation time, which is mandatory, which I think stinks."
164.00,165.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
165.00,166.00,SPEAKER_02, You know?
166.00,170.00,SPEAKER_02, Nobody's going to get back to work and back to normal.
170.00,171.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
171.00,176.00,SPEAKER_02," Not like taking courses, I might really like it, but I don't like taking summer courses, not like two at a time."
176.00,177.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
177.00,179.00,SPEAKER_02, It's so crammed in five weeks.
179.00,183.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, who do you like two chapters of after study for tomorrow?"
183.00,186.00,SPEAKER_02, I only read one thoroughly and the other one I'm going to read and learn.
186.00,193.00,SPEAKER_02, So I've got to go to the library and basically box myself in like a little cubicles and just read it and learn it that way.
193.00,194.00,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
194.00,199.00,SPEAKER_02, So I can't really concentrate on some totally away from things.
199.00,200.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
200.00,202.00,SPEAKER_02," Like I'm home with TV's on the other, Michael here."
202.00,203.00,SPEAKER_02, Right.
203.00,205.00,SPEAKER_02, I sleep and have just everything block everything out.
205.00,206.00,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
206.00,207.00,SPEAKER_02, I sleep away from study.
207.00,208.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
208.00,209.00,SPEAKER_02, I can't have a study from one Patrick.
209.00,211.00,SPEAKER_02, Because I'll read stuff.
211.00,214.00,SPEAKER_02," I'll read a book, but I can't like study."
214.00,216.00,SPEAKER_02, So I can't block everything out.
216.00,217.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
217.00,218.00,SPEAKER_01, So you guys are still seeing each other?
218.00,219.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
219.00,221.00,SPEAKER_02, It's weird because I'm colded after I wrote you.
221.00,222.00,SPEAKER_02, Now I was really bummed out.
222.00,223.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
223.00,225.00,SPEAKER_02, And we talked and stuff.
225.00,229.00,SPEAKER_02, And I told my missum and I was crying on the phone.
229.00,230.00,SPEAKER_02, He was crying on the phone.
230.00,231.00,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
231.00,233.00,SPEAKER_02," Because sitting in a miss me, he's going to miss you already."
233.00,235.00,SPEAKER_02," And it was like, you know, why are we doing this then?"
235.00,236.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
236.00,240.00,SPEAKER_02," So I figured we'd take more time, give him some more time."
240.00,243.00,SPEAKER_02," And like, he really waited like six months like in October."
243.00,244.00,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
244.00,248.00,SPEAKER_02," So we've been seeing each other up until, and I've still haven't seen each other."
248.00,251.00,SPEAKER_02," But like, I don't like going to family things with his."
251.00,257.00,SPEAKER_02," And when he's kind of weird, and I'm like, I wrote him a letter this past week and told him, how this is not enough."
257.00,259.00,SPEAKER_02," You know, I said, so you know this is going to happen at some point."
259.00,260.00,SPEAKER_02, You have to make a decision either.
260.00,261.00,SPEAKER_02, You want us to be together.
261.00,262.00,SPEAKER_02, You don't.
262.00,263.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
263.00,267.00,SPEAKER_02," You know, my feelings and it's just the way it has to be."
267.00,271.00,SPEAKER_02, So this isn't like it's a new relationship with each other for ten years.
271.00,273.00,SPEAKER_02, And we've got the good bad and ugly.
273.00,274.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
274.00,275.00,SPEAKER_02, And we're still here because we love each other.
275.00,276.00,SPEAKER_02, So that should mean something.
276.00,280.00,SPEAKER_02," And that should show you, you know, that should be significant somehow."
280.00,281.00,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
281.00,286.00,SPEAKER_02," I think it is, but we're going to talk about some stuff on Friday."
286.00,288.00,SPEAKER_02, And we're spending the day together Sunday.
288.00,290.00,SPEAKER_02, Is he working now?
290.00,291.00,SPEAKER_02, No.
291.00,292.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
292.00,293.00,SPEAKER_02, Can you get laid off?
293.00,295.00,SPEAKER_02," I think, I'm not sure if you get laid off."
295.00,296.00,SPEAKER_02, We'd laid off from grandma diet.
296.00,297.00,SPEAKER_01, I think he was.
297.00,298.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
298.00,299.00,SPEAKER_02," I think he was going to, I don't know."
299.00,300.00,SPEAKER_02, He was going to do something.
300.00,302.00,SPEAKER_02, If he got in some money for school.
302.00,303.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
303.00,307.00,SPEAKER_02," He took him English comp, which he got an A minus, and I believe."
307.00,309.00,SPEAKER_02," Because he really, he's a really good writer."
309.00,312.00,SPEAKER_02, He really writes from the soul.
312.00,316.00,SPEAKER_02," And he's taken of all things, an anime physiology, which is a toughest thing he could take."
316.00,317.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
317.00,318.00,SPEAKER_02, I know.
318.00,319.00,SPEAKER_01, I don't know why.
319.00,321.00,SPEAKER_02," I don't have a hard time with him, but his button is button."
321.00,324.00,SPEAKER_02, He's done some really good grades and some mediocre grades.
324.00,327.00,SPEAKER_02, So he wanted to prove to himself he could do it.
327.00,330.00,SPEAKER_02, So he took the hardest thing he had to take forever.
330.00,335.00,SPEAKER_02, And next time he'll just be doing the AMP of the alcohol abuse of the person.
335.00,338.00,SPEAKER_02, So he told me today he's got his test back.
338.00,343.00,SPEAKER_02," He thought he'd really well be got 68, and he's so ticked because he made some careless errors."
343.00,355.00,SPEAKER_02," He skipped one question and went on to the next, but then when he wrote the letters in, he put it on that particular one, and then we entered a question together three or just off because they weren't in the right spot."
355.00,361.00,SPEAKER_02," Like the last four, which were right, which he would have a credit for were wrong because he put them wrong."
361.00,362.00,SPEAKER_02, Right.
362.00,364.00,SPEAKER_02, He usually ticked off in himself.
364.00,365.00,SPEAKER_01, Is that passing?
365.00,366.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
366.00,367.00,SPEAKER_02, 68 is passing.
367.00,368.00,SPEAKER_01," I mean, a D is passing."
368.00,369.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
369.00,373.00,SPEAKER_01, We'll see if there's different scales that people have for grades.
373.00,377.00,SPEAKER_01," Sometimes that is like a, I don't know."
377.00,379.00,SPEAKER_01," I don't remember how it goes, but it's passing."
379.00,384.00,SPEAKER_02, But for some particular programs you have to have at least to see your better.
384.00,387.00,SPEAKER_02," So I was like, hey, I gotta be in English."
387.00,390.00,SPEAKER_02, That was like the first time I read in paper in like eight years.
390.00,392.00,SPEAKER_02, Was that an interesting class?
392.00,393.00,SPEAKER_02, I liked it.
393.00,394.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
394.00,395.00,SPEAKER_02, I didn't like the poetry.
395.00,398.00,SPEAKER_02," You have an analyzed poetry, but I liked English literature."
398.00,399.00,SPEAKER_02, I liked analyzing the stories.
399.00,400.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
400.00,401.00,SPEAKER_02, I enjoyed that part.
401.00,403.00,SPEAKER_02, That part once I got the hang of it was okay.
403.00,404.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
404.00,406.00,SPEAKER_02," My first paper I got a fan, and I knew the story really well."
406.00,408.00,SPEAKER_02, It was intelligently written.
408.00,410.00,SPEAKER_02, But I didn't like dig into it.
410.00,412.00,SPEAKER_02, And the second paper I got a B minus.
412.00,415.00,SPEAKER_02, And I didn't really like the author that story either.
415.00,417.00,SPEAKER_02, I didn't really understand the story so well.
417.00,418.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
418.00,419.00,SPEAKER_02, Called a Misfit.
419.00,421.00,SPEAKER_02," And it might be author, flanero, connery."
421.00,423.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, I've heard of them."
423.00,425.00,SPEAKER_02, But I've never read them.
425.00,427.00,SPEAKER_02," And the third one we did was Hamlet, which I loved."
427.00,428.00,SPEAKER_02, I love Shakespeare.
428.00,430.00,SPEAKER_02, So I had to write a paper.
430.00,431.00,SPEAKER_02, I didn't have to understand.
431.00,432.00,SPEAKER_02, I think it is.
432.00,436.00,SPEAKER_02, Because you have to keep going down the footnotes and like learning what the words mean.
436.00,437.00,SPEAKER_02, And stuff like that.
437.00,438.00,SPEAKER_02, But we also watched the film.
438.00,439.00,SPEAKER_02, I got the tape.
439.00,440.00,SPEAKER_02, The movie of Mel Gibson.
440.00,441.00,SPEAKER_02, I watched that.
441.00,442.00,SPEAKER_02, I really enjoyed that kind of thing.
442.00,443.00,SPEAKER_02, I wrote a good paper.
443.00,445.00,SPEAKER_02, I made it my little poem at the end of it.
445.00,447.00,SPEAKER_02, I had to be plus.
447.00,448.00,SPEAKER_02, I had to be plus.
448.00,450.00,SPEAKER_02, I clearly added more to it.
450.00,452.00,SPEAKER_02, It was really well done.
452.00,453.00,SPEAKER_02, It was really well done.
453.00,454.00,SPEAKER_02, It was the easiest paper for me to write.
454.00,456.00,SPEAKER_02, I don't know if it was because I had done to before that.
456.00,458.00,SPEAKER_02, I just really enjoyed the materials working.
458.00,459.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
459.00,460.00,SPEAKER_02, That helped.
460.00,461.00,SPEAKER_02, I felt like I got a really good grade in that.
461.00,462.00,SPEAKER_02, And I got to be on the course.
462.00,463.00,SPEAKER_02, But I worked really hard for it.
463.00,464.00,SPEAKER_02, And it wasn't easy.
464.00,465.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
465.00,468.00,SPEAKER_02, And then for second.
468.00,470.00,SPEAKER_02, So I got three A's of my tests for psychology.
470.00,472.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm taking one tomorrow.
472.00,475.00,SPEAKER_02, And then one next one's in my final grade.
475.00,476.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
476.00,479.00,SPEAKER_02," And then for my midterm and so sociology, I got an A."
479.00,483.00,SPEAKER_02, And then I'm taking my other final next week.
483.00,484.00,SPEAKER_02, So it's a lot of work.
484.00,486.00,SPEAKER_02, You're going to take any more classes after this.
486.00,487.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
487.00,491.00,SPEAKER_02, I'd like to take introduction to art or history.
491.00,494.00,SPEAKER_02, Or take a philosophy.
494.00,497.00,SPEAKER_02, And maybe I don't even know if I want to tackle a Spanish yet.
497.00,500.00,SPEAKER_02," I have to have a language, but I don't really know if I want to do it now."
500.00,502.00,SPEAKER_02, I think I'm going to take it.
502.00,503.00,SPEAKER_02, Do you guys have tele courses?
503.00,504.00,SPEAKER_01, Do you know what those are?
504.00,505.00,SPEAKER_01, What are they?
505.00,506.00,SPEAKER_01, Tele courses?
506.00,508.00,SPEAKER_01, It's like you get a video.
508.00,512.00,SPEAKER_01, And you just watch the video at home.
512.00,514.00,SPEAKER_01, And you do your own reading.
514.00,516.00,SPEAKER_01, And the work itself at home.
516.00,518.00,SPEAKER_01, And then you go in.
518.00,523.00,SPEAKER_01, So after they have a schedule set up to the school and take your test.
523.00,524.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, really?"
524.00,526.00,SPEAKER_01, Like in a testing center.
526.00,527.00,SPEAKER_00, Uh-huh.
527.00,531.00,SPEAKER_01, And I'm going to try that since I took a lot of French and high school.
531.00,532.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
532.00,534.00,SPEAKER_01, That maybe it won't be too hard to do it that way.
534.00,535.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm going to try it.
535.00,536.00,SPEAKER_02, Interesting.
536.00,537.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
537.00,538.00,SPEAKER_02, We did it.
538.00,539.00,SPEAKER_02, We'll see.
539.00,540.00,SPEAKER_02, Study evaluation on us.
540.00,542.00,SPEAKER_02, We had to write down in psychology.
542.00,547.00,SPEAKER_02," And it turned out that I'm a, I would call it something else."
547.00,548.00,SPEAKER_02, Something observer.
548.00,550.00,SPEAKER_02, Reflective observer when I study.
550.00,551.00,SPEAKER_02, Uh-huh.
551.00,554.00,SPEAKER_02," When I do things, I kind of like sit back and watch and stuff."
554.00,556.00,SPEAKER_02, Like we very quiet in the class.
556.00,558.00,SPEAKER_02, I don't like to participate a lot in the class.
558.00,559.00,SPEAKER_02, I pay attention.
559.00,560.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm always there.
560.00,561.00,SPEAKER_02, Uh-huh.
561.00,562.00,SPEAKER_02, They don't like to say a lot of stuff.
562.00,563.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
563.00,564.00,SPEAKER_02, Not in the psychology class.
564.00,565.00,SPEAKER_02, I don't.
565.00,567.00,SPEAKER_02, I just don't feel comfortable with it.
567.00,568.00,SPEAKER_02, Like with the people that are in there.
568.00,569.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
569.00,570.00,SPEAKER_02," So I just, I listen."
570.00,571.00,SPEAKER_02, So I know everything I can't break everything.
571.00,572.00,SPEAKER_02, I know everything.
572.00,573.00,SPEAKER_02, I know it.
573.00,574.00,SPEAKER_01, But is there younger students?
574.00,575.00,SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.
575.00,576.00,SPEAKER_01," Or just, are they most students?"
576.00,577.00,SPEAKER_01, No.
577.00,578.00,SPEAKER_02, Sure.
578.00,579.00,SPEAKER_02," Um, there's a mixture."
579.00,580.00,SPEAKER_02, Some high school kids.
580.00,581.00,SPEAKER_02, Like 1920 or old.
581.00,582.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
582.00,586.00,SPEAKER_02, And there's some married women in there and older women and younger kids.
586.00,588.00,SPEAKER_01, A couple of black people and that sounds about.
588.00,589.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
589.00,590.00,SPEAKER_01, It's like a good bag.
590.00,591.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
591.00,596.00,SPEAKER_02," But it seems like this kid who, and I'm saying, oh, I'm not being prejudiced to be black."
596.00,598.00,SPEAKER_02," And he's like, oh, he's questioning the teachers and stuff."
598.00,604.00,SPEAKER_02," And he thinks like, well, your father, you know, if you were told that you were brought up in the house, he'd do what he says."
604.00,606.00,SPEAKER_02," And that's, that's okay to learn that and stuff."
606.00,610.00,SPEAKER_02, And that's okay to do the kids and she's trying to teach them that it's not okay to do that.
610.00,611.00,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
611.00,614.00,SPEAKER_02, And I build someone's self-respecting to do things like that.
614.00,619.00,SPEAKER_02," And like, a couple of people like to argue with her and like, they think they're really ignorant and stupid."
619.00,620.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
620.00,622.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, so they got you to be the teachers."
622.00,623.00,SPEAKER_02, You should wear something.
623.00,624.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
624.00,625.00,SPEAKER_02," So, um, but it's good."
625.00,626.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, it's been interesting."
626.00,628.00,SPEAKER_02, They had a hypnotistic committee the other day.
628.00,634.00,SPEAKER_02," But I didn't want to do it just because I was first, I was skeptical of it and not really enthusiastic about it."
634.00,635.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
635.00,636.00,SPEAKER_02, I didn't feel comfortable.
636.00,639.00,SPEAKER_02," Like, I was more interested in watching people around me."
639.00,642.00,SPEAKER_02," Like, if they really kind of like really got into it."
642.00,644.00,SPEAKER_01, And I don't know if I would ever do it.
644.00,647.00,SPEAKER_01, I'd be real curious to see whether I could be hypnotized.
647.00,649.00,SPEAKER_01, I don't know if I would be a creator.
649.00,655.00,SPEAKER_02," But he said that we all have three minds here on the virtual, your reality."
655.00,657.00,SPEAKER_02, And then you're on the sensual.
657.00,667.00,SPEAKER_02, And he said that people get blocked as far as studying and stuff and doing things and getting like real uptight because people tend to think with two minds at the same time.
667.00,670.00,SPEAKER_02, And how your subconscious is your central line.
670.00,674.00,SPEAKER_02," And because one is like a yes, one is like a no, one is like a maybe."
674.00,676.00,SPEAKER_02, And he said you can get down.
676.00,680.00,SPEAKER_02," Like if your husband's, um, I talked in a sleep at some point."
680.00,682.00,SPEAKER_02, And that's his subconscious talking.
682.00,688.00,SPEAKER_02," So you could offer suggestions to him and he'll be like, he'll like, he'll listen to that."
688.00,689.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
689.00,690.00,SPEAKER_02, You know.
690.00,691.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, I think it's very interesting."
691.00,692.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
692.00,695.00,SPEAKER_02, I would like to try because there's something from my past that I like to find out they really happened or not.
695.00,696.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
696.00,699.00,SPEAKER_02," You know, look, I'm like crazy perverted cousins here."
699.00,703.00,SPEAKER_02, I really would like to find out because I remember some things that wasn't quite sure.
703.00,705.00,SPEAKER_02, You're crazy perverted cousin.
705.00,707.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh man, Alberta's son Gary."
707.00,710.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, I think he tried to molest you and I was a kid."
710.00,713.00,SPEAKER_02, And to this day it really bugs me.
713.00,714.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
714.00,720.00,SPEAKER_02, And I think that's why I have like a problem with my mother.
720.00,721.00,SPEAKER_02," Like an angry at her, you know."
721.00,722.00,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
722.00,723.00,SPEAKER_02, She put me in that situation.
723.00,724.00,SPEAKER_02, Oh.
724.00,726.00,SPEAKER_02, I think that's a lot to do with it too.
726.00,727.00,SPEAKER_01, How possible.
727.00,728.00,SPEAKER_01," See, she's still living her home."
728.00,729.00,SPEAKER_01," Yep, for now."
729.00,730.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
730.00,731.00,SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.
731.00,732.00,SPEAKER_02, You still have Jamie?
732.00,733.00,SPEAKER_02, Oh yeah.
733.00,734.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
734.00,735.00,SPEAKER_02, And she's doing well.
735.00,736.00,SPEAKER_02, She's still working.
736.00,739.00,SPEAKER_02, She's not doing much of anything for the summer.
739.00,743.00,SPEAKER_02, But she had a chance with summer camp to go to Boston.
743.00,744.00,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
744.00,747.00,SPEAKER_02, And she never wants Patrick and get the money for her deposit.
747.00,749.00,SPEAKER_02, So she just never got to do it.
749.00,750.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
750.00,753.00,SPEAKER_02, That's why I took off at her because all she had to do was go there and he was going to write the check for her.
753.00,754.00,SPEAKER_02, But she never showed up.
754.00,755.00,SPEAKER_02," So it's like, hey kid."
755.00,760.00,SPEAKER_02, But I know she's looking at different colleges and stuff.
760.00,761.00,SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.
761.00,763.00,SPEAKER_01," And her ability, just to be a last year's goal right?"
763.00,764.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
764.00,765.00,SPEAKER_02, Oh yeah.
765.00,766.00,SPEAKER_02, Thank God.
766.00,767.00,SPEAKER_02, Same with Adam.
767.00,768.00,SPEAKER_02, Yep.
768.00,769.00,SPEAKER_02," And, um, right."
769.00,770.00,SPEAKER_02," Stephen, now I'm back to court."
770.00,771.00,SPEAKER_02, Did I tell you that?
771.00,772.00,SPEAKER_02, Tell me you're going to.
772.00,773.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
773.00,775.00,SPEAKER_02, And his child's poor age increased by $60 a week.
775.00,776.00,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
776.00,777.00,SPEAKER_02, Which is good.
777.00,778.00,SPEAKER_02, Did he paint it?
778.00,779.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
779.00,781.00,SPEAKER_02," But it's by payroll reduction because he didn't, he refused to pay it."
781.00,782.00,SPEAKER_02, He went to.
782.00,783.00,SPEAKER_02, And I said no.
783.00,788.00,SPEAKER_02," Because she told him, you know, if he didn't pay it, it would be, like, a, be mandatory."
788.00,790.00,SPEAKER_02, So the court that it comes out of his paycheck.
790.00,791.00,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
791.00,792.00,SPEAKER_02, And he said he preferred that way.
792.00,795.00,SPEAKER_02," And I said, well, if he just gives you the money, we don't do that."
795.00,797.00,SPEAKER_02, Because I wouldn't want to pay all deduction like that.
797.00,798.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
798.00,800.00,SPEAKER_02, I think it would be embarrassing.
800.00,801.00,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
801.00,802.00,SPEAKER_02," But he said, no, he'd rather do it that way."
802.00,803.00,SPEAKER_02," And he, that's how it's done."
803.00,805.00,SPEAKER_02, So he had a check every week.
805.00,806.00,SPEAKER_00, Mm-hmm.
806.00,807.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, it's a good thing they have that."
807.00,809.00,SPEAKER_02, Because otherwise you wouldn't get it.
809.00,810.00,SPEAKER_02, I know.
810.00,814.00,SPEAKER_02," So, um, and then the money he owes me, he was like $1,800."
814.00,815.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
815.00,817.00,SPEAKER_02, From before the court order went into effect.
817.00,818.00,SPEAKER_02, Right.
818.00,823.00,SPEAKER_02," And when Jamie turns 14, which is in January, he'll start paying me that amount."
823.00,824.00,SPEAKER_02, 14.
824.00,826.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, I'm sorry, 18."
826.00,827.00,SPEAKER_02, On the 14th.
827.00,828.00,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
828.00,833.00,SPEAKER_02," So he'll be paying that balance off at that rate, say, 140 a week until it's paid."
833.00,835.00,SPEAKER_02, Now we'll get her through Northwest.
835.00,838.00,SPEAKER_02, Because her tuition payments are $400 a month.
838.00,839.00,SPEAKER_02, For high school.
839.00,840.00,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
840.00,841.00,SPEAKER_02, Wow.
841.00,842.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
842.00,843.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, she's got good education."
843.00,844.00,SPEAKER_02, She's got a good start.
844.00,845.00,SPEAKER_02, And she's not really well in Catholic school.
845.00,847.00,SPEAKER_02, She's been in Catholic school for six years.
847.00,848.00,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
848.00,854.00,SPEAKER_02," And this is like, finally, Patrick and I paid for the past five."
854.00,857.00,SPEAKER_02, And I paid myself for the past two or three.
857.00,858.00,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
858.00,860.00,SPEAKER_02, So I figure he can help pay for the last year.
860.00,862.00,SPEAKER_02, Because it's really been a big burden.
862.00,863.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
863.00,868.00,SPEAKER_02, So that money he gives me is going to be more than enough to cover her tuition payment.
868.00,870.00,SPEAKER_02, And I'll put some money so I can save his account.
870.00,871.00,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
871.00,872.00,SPEAKER_02, Leave it there.
872.00,873.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
873.00,874.00,SPEAKER_02, You know?
874.00,875.00,SPEAKER_02, So it worked out really well.
875.00,876.00,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
876.00,878.00,SPEAKER_02, So things are looking up that way.
878.00,883.00,SPEAKER_02," Um, I told Patrick, um, we talked on stuff."
883.00,887.00,SPEAKER_02, I told him he wanted to keep me hit a mirror me by the next July 17th.
887.00,888.00,SPEAKER_02, That's right.
888.00,889.00,SPEAKER_02, A vorcery.
889.00,891.00,SPEAKER_02," Our anniversary went by and I was, we talked about it and stuff."
891.00,894.00,SPEAKER_02," I said, would have been married eight years."
894.00,895.00,SPEAKER_02, You know?
895.00,898.00,SPEAKER_02," And I told him, if you gotta keep me, you gotta be happy."
898.00,899.00,SPEAKER_02, You have to marry me.
899.00,900.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm not going to be this kept one.
900.00,901.00,SPEAKER_02, So no way.
901.00,902.00,SPEAKER_02, So what do you say?
902.00,904.00,SPEAKER_02, You just start laughing.
904.00,912.00,SPEAKER_02," But, um, I told him, I wrote him a letter this past week and told him, we have to, you know, talk about things and get things out."
912.00,915.00,SPEAKER_02, Because I told him there were components that had to be in our relationship.
915.00,917.00,SPEAKER_02, People wanted to be together and be married.
917.00,920.00,SPEAKER_02, That's mutual respect and the wanting to be together.
920.00,921.00,SPEAKER_02," And, you know, stuff like that."
921.00,924.00,SPEAKER_02," I feel for you, I still feel that for me."
924.00,926.00,SPEAKER_02," I said, then this relationship can't survive."
926.00,927.00,SPEAKER_02, You know?
927.00,934.00,SPEAKER_02," I'm trying to be realistic about it, but it would hurt very much if he still doesn't want to get married."
934.00,935.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
935.00,936.00,SPEAKER_02," But, same time."
936.00,939.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm not going to wait for him for five years and I'm in the same spot.
939.00,940.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm in now two years or no.
940.00,944.00,SPEAKER_02," It doesn't make, and I can't, I can't foresee doing that."
944.00,945.00,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
945.00,948.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, I wouldn't want to wait for him, but it's like, I know it's coming."
948.00,951.00,SPEAKER_02," I would, I would do gladly wait, but if he keeps saying, I don't know, I don't know."
951.00,952.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
952.00,953.00,SPEAKER_02, If I please.
953.00,954.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I've been into it."
954.00,955.00,SPEAKER_01, Huh?
955.00,956.00,SPEAKER_01, There has to be an end to it.
956.00,957.00,SPEAKER_01, Something else.
957.00,959.00,SPEAKER_01," I can't see closure with it, you know."
959.00,963.00,SPEAKER_01," I hope it isn't how it goes, but I don't know."
963.00,964.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
964.00,967.00,SPEAKER_01," So, do you ever see you in the family?"
967.00,969.00,SPEAKER_02," I saw, I saw Sam."
969.00,975.00,SPEAKER_02," Actually, I supposed to go there for Memorial Day Pipping, but then I'm going to Joey's friend got killed."
975.00,976.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, no."
976.00,977.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, he was a kid."
977.00,980.00,SPEAKER_02," He was a balantret, a bar, illusions or odd if he or something."
980.00,981.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
981.00,984.00,SPEAKER_02, When he called that country music place.
984.00,985.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
985.00,989.00,SPEAKER_02," And somebody's car alarm went off in the parking lot, and he went out to investigate it."
989.00,993.00,SPEAKER_02, And whoever was breaking into the car to ask him when he came out.
993.00,996.00,SPEAKER_02," He hit him, he hit him in the hay with a screwdriver."
996.00,999.00,SPEAKER_02, He'd like plunge into the kid's head.
999.00,1000.00,SPEAKER_02, It's pretty nasty.
1000.00,1001.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, my God."
1001.00,1002.00,SPEAKER_02, Joe was really bummed out.
1002.00,1005.00,SPEAKER_02," Plus Uncle Joe, I think it wasn't doing so well."
1005.00,1007.00,SPEAKER_02, It was about a life being really sick and stuff.
1007.00,1008.00,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
1008.00,1011.00,SPEAKER_02," Because I know literally, literally, I'm so they want an vacation."
1011.00,1013.00,SPEAKER_02, And then she called me up a week ago.
1013.00,1015.00,SPEAKER_02, I want to take me up my birthday.
1015.00,1017.00,SPEAKER_02, And her and I are not dying.
1017.00,1019.00,SPEAKER_02, And my dad wanted to go too.
1019.00,1021.00,SPEAKER_02, Robert wants to go.
1021.00,1026.00,SPEAKER_02," So, I haven't talked to her in about a week."
1026.00,1028.00,SPEAKER_02," So, I got a card from her today."
1028.00,1031.00,SPEAKER_02, She said she had talked to me and seen me soon.
1031.00,1034.00,SPEAKER_01," So, did you do anything special for a birthday?"
1034.00,1036.00,SPEAKER_02, My father went to the hospital.
1036.00,1040.00,SPEAKER_02, The sworn she had had a pocket of fluid aspirator from her.
1040.00,1042.00,SPEAKER_02, Just behind her liver or something.
1042.00,1044.00,SPEAKER_02, She had some kind of little infection there.
1044.00,1048.00,SPEAKER_02, And I had a family with me overnight because Pat and Rook and I were done yesterday.
1048.00,1049.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1049.00,1052.00,SPEAKER_02, And I had to go to the last afternoon and I had to do some errands.
1052.00,1054.00,SPEAKER_02, I had to go to school at five.
1054.00,1056.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, it doesn't sound like a great birthday."
1056.00,1057.00,SPEAKER_02, No.
1057.00,1058.00,SPEAKER_02, This weekend we're going to be better.
1058.00,1059.00,SPEAKER_02, Because Pat wanted to take me out.
1059.00,1061.00,SPEAKER_02," I said, we're trying to get our schedule together."
1061.00,1063.00,SPEAKER_02," And then just like, there's no way we can."
1063.00,1065.00,SPEAKER_02, Because I'm at school four evenings a week.
1065.00,1066.00,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
1066.00,1067.00,SPEAKER_02, 6 to 9.
1067.00,1068.00,SPEAKER_02, 30.
1068.00,1070.00,SPEAKER_02, And he has school Tuesday and what Thursday.
1070.00,1071.00,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
1071.00,1072.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm five to 10.
1072.00,1076.00,SPEAKER_02, And then in the weekend I'm having a family Friday and then Saturday he's studying and I've got a lot of paperwork.
1076.00,1079.00,SPEAKER_02, And I've got a lot of paper for sociology.
1079.00,1081.00,SPEAKER_02," So, Sunday we're playing a family day together."
1081.00,1083.00,SPEAKER_02, Maybe we'll do some lunch or something on Friday.
1083.00,1084.00,SPEAKER_01, Is this your 40?
1084.00,1085.00,SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.
1085.00,1086.00,SPEAKER_01, That's what I thought.
1086.00,1087.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1087.00,1088.00,SPEAKER_01, Mine will be next year.
1088.00,1089.00,SPEAKER_01, I know.
1089.00,1090.00,SPEAKER_01, It's like I'm creaking.
1090.00,1091.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm creaking.
1091.00,1092.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm not looking forward to it.
1092.00,1094.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm not looking forward to 39.
1094.00,1096.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm not looking forward to that snap-at.
1096.00,1099.00,SPEAKER_02, I haven't because I really haven't had time to think about it.
1099.00,1100.00,SPEAKER_02, I did last week.
1100.00,1102.00,SPEAKER_02," I'm like, oh my god."
1102.00,1105.00,SPEAKER_02," If we ever think my life is here, over with, what have I done?"
1105.00,1107.00,SPEAKER_02, What should I have done differently?
1107.00,1108.00,SPEAKER_02, What should I always know?
1108.00,1111.00,SPEAKER_02, Because I was hitching the face at some point or other anyway.
1111.00,1118.00,SPEAKER_02, Or you could say you're just beginning and you're just touring and learning and you just go for what you really think will make you happy.
1118.00,1121.00,SPEAKER_01, And you probably live longer than 80.
1121.00,1122.00,SPEAKER_01, Oh god.
1122.00,1123.00,SPEAKER_01, I don't want to look on the mirror.
1123.00,1124.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm going to go to the old face.
1124.00,1126.00,SPEAKER_02, Not me.
1126.00,1127.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm being.
1127.00,1129.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm going to just have to get a face with.
1129.00,1130.00,SPEAKER_02," Ah, talk here."
1130.00,1131.00,SPEAKER_02, Talk there.
1131.00,1133.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm breastly dragging on the ground.
1133.00,1135.00,SPEAKER_02, But my face will be intact.
1135.00,1138.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, this is true."
1138.00,1140.00,SPEAKER_02," It's like, oh god."
1140.00,1144.00,SPEAKER_02," I haven't wanted to start working out for like five months, but it's my knee."
1144.00,1147.00,SPEAKER_02," And then I had an expression, my foot, a month later."
1147.00,1150.00,SPEAKER_02," And I was like, oh, I tripped down the stairs and I just twisted my foot the wrong way."
1150.00,1152.00,SPEAKER_01, Did you have to miss work then too?
1152.00,1159.00,SPEAKER_02, One day I missed only because I got permission to wear one of those walking shoes to work.
1159.00,1162.00,SPEAKER_02," And normally I don't want to do that, but I told them, you know, I said I can't not work."
1162.00,1163.00,SPEAKER_02, And I said it was okay to do it.
1163.00,1166.00,SPEAKER_02, So I had that for like a week.
1166.00,1172.00,SPEAKER_02, And then I just went back to where my sneaker and keeping like an ace ankle support on it.
1172.00,1175.00,SPEAKER_02," And it wasn't up until a couple weeks, so it really felt good."
1175.00,1178.00,SPEAKER_02, But the ache just totally went away and healed all by itself.
1178.00,1182.00,SPEAKER_01, It's been a queer year.
1182.00,1184.00,SPEAKER_01, A little bit before the 30 minutes is up.
1184.00,1185.00,SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.
1185.00,1188.00,SPEAKER_01," We'll get a warning, but I can call you back if you still want to talk."
1188.00,1191.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, you know, for the middle of the talking."
1191.00,1192.00,SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh.
1192.00,1193.00,SPEAKER_01," Okay, whatever."
1193.00,1195.00,SPEAKER_01," Okay, you're taking a vacation at all this year?"
1195.00,1197.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, we're going to take some next month."
1197.00,1200.00,SPEAKER_01, We're going to probably go up to the block hills without Dakota.
1200.00,1201.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, neat."
1201.00,1202.00,SPEAKER_01, Go camping.
1202.00,1205.00,SPEAKER_01, We've gone up there several at the time.
1205.00,1208.00,SPEAKER_01," So, probably just be me and Al, though."
1208.00,1210.00,SPEAKER_01, Adam doesn't want to go.
1210.00,1213.00,SPEAKER_01," That's, you know, boring to go with your parents."
1213.00,1215.00,SPEAKER_01," Of course, I hope you know that someday."
1215.00,1216.00,SPEAKER_01, He's working.
1216.00,1219.00,SPEAKER_01," You know, he could get the time off, but, you know, that's a excuse."
1219.00,1221.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, I have to work."
1221.00,1226.00,SPEAKER_01," So, I'm hoping he'll change his mind, but I don't know."
1226.00,1227.00,SPEAKER_01, I want an eyeser guy.
1227.00,1229.00,SPEAKER_01, Don't kind of change your mind.
1229.00,1230.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm not counting on it.
1230.00,1231.00,SPEAKER_01, Are you going to be coming up with a ticket?
1231.00,1232.00,SPEAKER_01, No?
1232.00,1233.00,SPEAKER_01, No?
1233.00,1234.00,SPEAKER_01, No?
1234.00,1235.00,SPEAKER_01, I don't think so.
1235.00,1236.00,SPEAKER_01, Kind of expensive.
1236.00,1237.00,SPEAKER_01," Rest of fly, you know."
1237.00,1238.00,," That's true, too."
1238.00,1239.00,SPEAKER_01, And drive it is.
1239.00,1240.00,SPEAKER_01, Forget drive it.
1240.00,1242.00,SPEAKER_01, It's too far.
1242.00,1243.00,SPEAKER_01, What happens?
1243.00,1244.00,SPEAKER_01, I haven't seen any cousins.
1244.00,1245.00,SPEAKER_01, I haven't seen them for a while.
1245.00,1246.00,SPEAKER_02," No, that's a few minutes."
1246.00,1248.00,SPEAKER_02," No, Denise is pregnant."
1248.00,1249.00,SPEAKER_02, I wish he.
1249.00,1252.00,SPEAKER_02, I think Julie and her husband finally separated.
1252.00,1253.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, you're kidding."
1253.00,1254.00,SPEAKER_02," No, I thought they were working."
1254.00,1256.00,SPEAKER_02, I think Julie and her husband finally separated.
1256.00,1257.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, you're kidding."
1257.00,1258.00,SPEAKER_02," No, I thought they were working."
1258.00,1259.00,SPEAKER_02, I think Julie and her husband finally separated.
1259.00,1260.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, you're kidding."
1260.00,1262.00,SPEAKER_02," I thought they worked himself, but I guess not."
1262.00,1263.00,SPEAKER_02, I didn't know they were having problems.
1263.00,1265.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, not the answer they were before."
1265.00,1267.00,SPEAKER_02, I think they said Julie moved out.
1267.00,1268.00,SPEAKER_02, That's too bad.
1268.00,1269.00,SPEAKER_00, Mm-hmm.
1269.00,1271.00,SPEAKER_02, And I'm not.
1271.00,1273.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm not even doing okay.
1273.00,1274.00,SPEAKER_02, Who?
1274.00,1275.00,SPEAKER_02, Fonda.
1275.00,1276.00,SPEAKER_02, I guess she's doing okay.
1276.00,1277.00,SPEAKER_02, How about Lillian?
1277.00,1279.00,SPEAKER_02, Lillian's doing all right.
1279.00,1281.00,SPEAKER_02," Um, we should look if she has Joe."
1281.00,1282.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1282.00,1283.00,SPEAKER_02," You know, otherwise she'd be."
1283.00,1284.00,SPEAKER_02, She'd lose it.
1284.00,1285.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1285.00,1287.00,SPEAKER_02, Which one's very good to me.
1287.00,1288.00,SPEAKER_01, Hmm?
1288.00,1289.00,SPEAKER_02, So she's been very good to me.
1289.00,1290.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, yeah."
1290.00,1292.00,SPEAKER_01, She's always been real good about remembering my birthday.
1292.00,1293.00,SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh.
1293.00,1294.00,SPEAKER_02, And she has a big heart.
1294.00,1295.00,SPEAKER_02, She's really good.
1295.00,1296.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1296.00,1298.00,SPEAKER_02, That band's doing okay.
1298.00,1300.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, I haven't been to the cemetery yet."
1300.00,1301.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, yeah."
1301.00,1302.00,SPEAKER_02, Even though where to go.
1302.00,1303.00,SPEAKER_02," Fine, grandma."
1303.00,1304.00,SPEAKER_02, You don't?
1304.00,1305.00,SPEAKER_02, No.
1305.00,1306.00,SPEAKER_02, You don't remember?
1306.00,1307.00,SPEAKER_02, I know where we were.
1307.00,1309.00,SPEAKER_02," That area, but I don't know exactly where."
1309.00,1310.00,SPEAKER_02, Mom.
1310.00,1311.00,SPEAKER_02, But she is.
1311.00,1312.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1312.00,1313.00,SPEAKER_02, You know what I mean?
1313.00,1314.00,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
1314.00,1315.00,SPEAKER_02, I have to get up there someday.
1315.00,1316.00,SPEAKER_02, I want to go there.
1316.00,1317.00,SPEAKER_02, But I don't want to do what I don't want.
1317.00,1318.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1318.00,1319.00,SPEAKER_02," You know, I think about her."
1319.00,1321.00,SPEAKER_02, I thought about her the other day and started to cry.
1321.00,1323.00,SPEAKER_02, I certainly missed that talk on tour.
1323.00,1324.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1324.00,1325.00,SPEAKER_01, I was just thinking about that tonight.
1325.00,1328.00,SPEAKER_01," You know, because you, you, you just call her pretty often, didn't you?"
1328.00,1329.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, yeah."
1329.00,1330.00,SPEAKER_02, She goes over all the time and serious.
1330.00,1332.00,SPEAKER_02, She's still hugging her all the time.
1332.00,1335.00,SPEAKER_02, And I would finally be like you were a big hug until I loved her.
1335.00,1337.00,SPEAKER_02, She was so sweet.
1337.00,1338.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1338.00,1339.00,SPEAKER_02, She'd make me teen.
1339.00,1340.00,SPEAKER_02, And she's a little cookies.
1340.00,1342.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm so funny.
1342.00,1345.00,SPEAKER_01, Do you want your teen now or later?
1345.00,1346.00,SPEAKER_01, I know.
1346.00,1350.00,SPEAKER_01," I keep picturing her house and I keep thinking she's still there, you know."
1350.00,1351.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1351.00,1354.00,SPEAKER_01, I can't quite imagine her not being there.
1354.00,1357.00,SPEAKER_02," So, you know, she was a doll."
1357.00,1364.00,SPEAKER_02," I guess not only I want to, um, we're just, um, must her name."
1364.00,1365.00,SPEAKER_02, This is Mother Angela.
1365.00,1366.00,SPEAKER_02, This is not Angeline.
1366.00,1367.00,SPEAKER_02," God, grandma."
1367.00,1368.00,SPEAKER_02, Sister Angelica.
1368.00,1371.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, is it Nashville or someplace?"
1371.00,1372.00,SPEAKER_02, I have her Tennessee.
1372.00,1373.00,SPEAKER_02, I have her Tennessee.
1373.00,1374.00,SPEAKER_02, She went there.
1374.00,1376.00,SPEAKER_02, She enjoyed on vacation.
1376.00,1378.00,SPEAKER_02, She met Sister Angelica.
1378.00,1379.00,SPEAKER_02, Really?
1379.00,1380.00,SPEAKER_02, Mother Angelica.
1380.00,1381.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1381.00,1382.00,SPEAKER_02," Yes, it's very sweet."
1382.00,1383.00,SPEAKER_01, Huh.
1383.00,1385.00,SPEAKER_02, Grandma would have liked it to have done that.
1385.00,1386.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, yeah, I know."
1386.00,1388.00,SPEAKER_02, She's always talking about her.
1388.00,1390.00,SPEAKER_02, Because I have Mother Angelica's book here.
1390.00,1391.00,SPEAKER_02, I only gave to me.
1391.00,1392.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, yeah."
1392.00,1393.00,SPEAKER_02, Was it been good?
1393.00,1394.00,SPEAKER_02, I have had a chance to read it.
1394.00,1395.00,SPEAKER_02, I haven't done any.
1395.00,1396.00,," Oh, I know."
1396.00,1397.00,SPEAKER_02, I know.
1397.00,1398.00,SPEAKER_02, I know.
1398.00,1399.00,SPEAKER_01, And I know.
1399.00,1401.00,SPEAKER_01, And I know when I'm going to read it to friggin' book.
1401.00,1402.00,SPEAKER_01, I picked the summer off.
1402.00,1403.00,SPEAKER_01, It's been really nice.
1403.00,1404.00,SPEAKER_01, I haven't taken any classes.
1404.00,1409.00,SPEAKER_02," So, you know, I mean, I want to because I have an interview with St. Joseph's College."
1409.00,1411.00,SPEAKER_02," On 18th, they're 14 to the longest."
1411.00,1413.00,SPEAKER_02, Because I interviewed two years ago.
1413.00,1416.00,SPEAKER_02, And the woman said that would be really good student.
1416.00,1418.00,SPEAKER_02," For one, I had to get my classes built up."
1418.00,1419.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, to get into the college."
1419.00,1420.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1420.00,1421.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, thank you meant for a job."
1421.00,1422.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, no, no, no."
1422.00,1425.00,SPEAKER_02, For playing as for this nursing program.
1425.00,1428.00,SPEAKER_02," So when I get done with these courses, I have 12 credits."
1428.00,1435.00,SPEAKER_02," I'll take three, two or three more courses this fall."
1435.00,1439.00,SPEAKER_02," If I can get three courses in, I'm like a Tuesday and a Thursday or Monday and Wednesday."
1439.00,1442.00,SPEAKER_02, I really don't want to go Monday or Tuesday or Thursday.
1442.00,1443.00,SPEAKER_02, Right.
1443.00,1444.00,SPEAKER_02, 12 weeks.
1444.00,1447.00,SPEAKER_02," So just if I make me crazy, I couldn't do it."
1447.00,1454.00,SPEAKER_02," So if I could do it in doing two likes to take seven o'clock classes or six o'clock class and eight o'clock class, then alternate."
1454.00,1457.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, get the same nights for three courses."
1457.00,1458.00,SPEAKER_02, I would do it.
1458.00,1459.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1459.00,1461.00,SPEAKER_02, If I had my evenings free.
1461.00,1464.00,SPEAKER_02," But doing four evenings a week is that it's, oh, I know."
1464.00,1467.00,SPEAKER_02, Especially working full time on top of that.
1467.00,1471.00,SPEAKER_01," I have a hard enough time to go in school, work in part time."
1471.00,1475.00,SPEAKER_02, At least I got some good grades this time.
1475.00,1476.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1476.00,1477.00,SPEAKER_02, So I have a B. average.
1477.00,1479.00,SPEAKER_02," I have two, my English is I have bees."
1479.00,1480.00,SPEAKER_02, And a second.
1480.00,1482.00,SPEAKER_02, So should I do really well tomorrow?
1482.00,1485.00,SPEAKER_02, Hopefully I'll get another A in my test.
1485.00,1486.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, good luck."
1486.00,1487.00,SPEAKER_02, Thanks.
1487.00,1489.00,SPEAKER_02, I have someone to cover.
1489.00,1493.00,SPEAKER_02, I have 65 pages to go over and learn those two chapters.
1493.00,1497.00,SPEAKER_02," And it's on personality and motivation, which is interesting."
1497.00,1498.00,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
1498.00,1502.00,SPEAKER_02, But the one I hated the most was on learning about love.
1502.00,1503.00,SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh.
1503.00,1504.00,SPEAKER_01, Theories.
1504.00,1508.00,SPEAKER_01, And the synodumulus and the brain and all that.
1508.00,1510.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, I learned it."
1510.00,1513.00,SPEAKER_02, I learned better under pressure.
1513.00,1523.00,SPEAKER_02," Like I went, I go to school, I read the chapters through for hand, and then I go to the labre like one o'clock in the afternoon, and I sit there, I reread it and read it and read it until like 6, 5, 30 at night."
1523.00,1526.00,SPEAKER_02, And I take a half an hour and just don't even look at the book.
1526.00,1529.00,SPEAKER_02," Then we'll take the test as soon as we go into the room, which is nice."
1529.00,1530.00,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
1530.00,1531.00,SPEAKER_02, But that's why I have to learn.
1531.00,1532.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1532.00,1536.00,SPEAKER_02, I have to just do a quietly and just read it to myself and try to apply to stuff.
1536.00,1537.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1537.00,1538.00,SPEAKER_02, So I hope I do really well tomorrow.
1538.00,1540.00,SPEAKER_02, But I really haven't gone over it like I should have yet.
1540.00,1541.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1541.00,1543.00,SPEAKER_02, So I'd be really cramming tomorrow.
1543.00,1544.00,SPEAKER_02, Do you work into tomorrow?
1544.00,1545.00,SPEAKER_02, No.
1545.00,1546.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm not going back to work on Monday.
1546.00,1547.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, that's right."
1547.00,1548.00,SPEAKER_02, So I hurt my back.
1548.00,1549.00,SPEAKER_02, That's right.
1549.00,1551.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm sharing like shit and error section last last week.
1551.00,1555.00,SPEAKER_02," I took her to the walk-in and she was crying and she was like, so miserable."
1555.00,1556.00,SPEAKER_02, I went to pick her up.
1556.00,1558.00,SPEAKER_01," And I was like, bah, didn't I do that anymore?"
1558.00,1560.00,SPEAKER_02," I think he's good by me, Hannix."
1560.00,1563.00,SPEAKER_02, So her ear is better.
1563.00,1565.00,SPEAKER_02, It was a little hot and miserable up here.
1565.00,1566.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1566.00,1568.00,SPEAKER_01, I was like in the 80s and 90s and really humid.
1568.00,1570.00,SPEAKER_01," I was like in the 100s here, 109."
1570.00,1571.00,SPEAKER_01, Oh my God.
1571.00,1572.00,SPEAKER_01, I understand it.
1572.00,1574.00,SPEAKER_01, Because I'm muggy or I have air conditioning.
1574.00,1576.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, you have to have air conditioning."
1576.00,1577.00,SPEAKER_01, You couldn't survive.
1577.00,1578.00,SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh.
1578.00,1580.00,SPEAKER_01," That would be, no, but in the 90s now."
1580.00,1584.00,SPEAKER_01, It'll be in the 90s probably through July and most of August.
1584.00,1585.00,SPEAKER_01, Really?
1585.00,1586.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1586.00,1587.00,SPEAKER_01, And it's pretty humid too.
1587.00,1588.00,SPEAKER_01, So yeah.
1588.00,1589.00,SPEAKER_02, But go.
1589.00,1591.00,SPEAKER_01," Like I said, you don't think I'd have air conditioning."
1591.00,1592.00,SPEAKER_01, I have it in my car too.
1592.00,1594.00,SPEAKER_02, So you don't have it in my car.
1594.00,1596.00,SPEAKER_02," It's like, it's making me crazy."
1596.00,1600.00,SPEAKER_02, So my mother's car to school to land while she was at the hospital film.
1600.00,1601.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, if she home now."
1601.00,1602.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1602.00,1603.00,SPEAKER_02, What are we home?
1603.00,1605.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, she went in and out the same day."
1605.00,1606.00,, Wow.
1606.00,1607.00,, So.
1607.00,1608.00,SPEAKER_02, My father.
1608.00,1609.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1609.00,1610.00,SPEAKER_02, Let's see.
1610.00,1611.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm going to ask you about her.
1611.00,1613.00,SPEAKER_02, Jerry moved out finally.
1613.00,1614.00,SPEAKER_02, Shaped him out.
1614.00,1615.00,SPEAKER_02, Did he move out in April?
1615.00,1617.00,SPEAKER_01," Like he was, because Eddie was going to."
1617.00,1618.00,SPEAKER_01, Oh no.
1618.00,1619.00,SPEAKER_01, No.
1619.00,1621.00,SPEAKER_01, She went and found a box of condoms in the car.
1621.00,1623.00,SPEAKER_01, I kind of wondered about that when he said he was going to move out.
1623.00,1625.00,SPEAKER_01, If there was another woman.
1625.00,1626.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, there hasn't all along."
1626.00,1627.00,SPEAKER_01, So a couple of them.
1627.00,1629.00,SPEAKER_02, The whole time that he was with her.
1629.00,1630.00,SPEAKER_02, Uh huh.
1630.00,1631.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1631.00,1634.00,SPEAKER_02, Apparently she ran to his ex-wife when.
1634.00,1637.00,SPEAKER_02, And then quite a conversation one evening last week.
1637.00,1638.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1638.00,1641.00,SPEAKER_02, And I guess he was looking for a house of Bobby and dating her.
1641.00,1644.00,SPEAKER_02, He was still getting out of the wind.
1644.00,1645.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, good."
1645.00,1649.00,SPEAKER_02, And he was telling when the Bob was a lesbian and this and then Bob was a psycho.
1649.00,1656.00,SPEAKER_02, And he was telling Bob that when was a psycho and this and then she was a guy who really messed up.
1656.00,1661.00,SPEAKER_02, So she was going out and when was the mother of his son Caroline.
1661.00,1662.00,SPEAKER_02, It's like ridiculous.
1662.00,1664.00,SPEAKER_02, It's like unbelievable.
1664.00,1666.00,SPEAKER_02, When did she take him out?
1666.00,1667.00,SPEAKER_02, A couple months ago.
1667.00,1669.00,SPEAKER_02, She found some condoms in this car.
1669.00,1673.00,SPEAKER_02, She approached him about it because I guess they were taking a son out for something.
1673.00,1675.00,SPEAKER_02," And she just like, what is this?"
1675.00,1680.00,SPEAKER_02," When, to talk for one, saying this basically denied it and she went in the house."
1680.00,1683.00,SPEAKER_02, I guess he's about to come out and go because they were going to go somewhere.
1683.00,1685.00,SPEAKER_02, And when he was gone she changed a lot of stuff.
1685.00,1687.00,SPEAKER_02, He came back and he called her.
1687.00,1689.00,SPEAKER_02, He was swearing out to the door corner.
1689.00,1691.00,SPEAKER_02, Evan bitching this and that and stuff.
1691.00,1692.00,SPEAKER_02, And he was mad.
1692.00,1698.00,SPEAKER_02," And she found out she could, and she locked him out and she will come in and get to go to police there and stuff."
1698.00,1700.00,SPEAKER_02, And he ended up coming in and getting some of these things.
1700.00,1704.00,SPEAKER_02, But he hasn't gone back to get like his coach and stuff.
1704.00,1707.00,SPEAKER_02, And so much other things and no one heard of her from him since.
1707.00,1710.00,SPEAKER_02, So that is really messed up.
1710.00,1715.00,SPEAKER_02, He was messing around with body while he was living with her.
1715.00,1717.00,SPEAKER_02, And really disgusting.
1717.00,1719.00,SPEAKER_02, And it's pathetic at the same time.
1719.00,1720.00,SPEAKER_01, I worry about diseases too.
1720.00,1721.00,SPEAKER_02, I know.
1721.00,1728.00,SPEAKER_02, She's just getting a tree for AIDS and herpes and stuff and all kinds of sexually transmitted diseases and growth.
1728.00,1733.00,SPEAKER_02," And I'm like, you know, I knew I kind of knew but didn't want to think about that."
1733.00,1736.00,SPEAKER_02," And Patrick said, when did I tell you all along?"
1736.00,1738.00,SPEAKER_02, It's a black guy's like they have no qualms.
1738.00,1740.00,SPEAKER_02, I haven't come to live in their life.
1740.00,1742.00,SPEAKER_02, And they think nothing's wrong with it.
1742.00,1744.00,SPEAKER_01, It does tend to be true at all times.
1744.00,1745.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1745.00,1746.00,SPEAKER_01, And he's just a flea bag.
1746.00,1748.00,SPEAKER_01, I don't think a thing she didn't marry him.
1748.00,1751.00,SPEAKER_01," I mean, he didn't want to marry her anyway."
1751.00,1756.00,SPEAKER_02," But no, but where she's like wanting to marry him, getting pregnant and stuff like you imagine."
1756.00,1760.00,SPEAKER_02, I somehow two of them Manninghing.
1760.00,1762.00,SPEAKER_02, Previous man and having him around her neck.
1762.00,1765.00,SPEAKER_02, The rest of your life.
1765.00,1766.00,SPEAKER_02, W W A T.
1766.00,1775.00,SPEAKER_02, rites doesn't know any way.
1775.00,1776.00,SPEAKER_02," She might have a new honey and I said oh my, my god."
1776.00,1785.00,SPEAKER_02, Who and I guess that's the fact the backging and I was so preparing for her.
1785.00,1787.00,SPEAKER_02," or something, you know, and I was like, oh my god."
1787.00,1789.00,SPEAKER_02, More torture.
1789.00,1791.00,SPEAKER_01," She's still living in her house, right?"
1791.00,1792.00,SPEAKER_02, Oh yeah.
1792.00,1793.00,SPEAKER_02, But she has a roommate.
1793.00,1795.00,SPEAKER_01, She has a wicked high mortgage.
1795.00,1796.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, it's good."
1796.00,1797.00,SPEAKER_01, I didn't think she could afford it.
1797.00,1798.00,SPEAKER_02, She's looking for roommates.
1798.00,1800.00,SPEAKER_02," I guess she's one one person's really liked, but then he found..."
