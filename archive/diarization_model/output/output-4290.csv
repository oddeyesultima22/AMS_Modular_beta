0.00,3.00,SPEAKER_02, I want to be recorded.
3.00,4.00,SPEAKER_01, Sure.
4.00,6.00,SPEAKER_02," Okay, now I can talk up to 30 minutes."
6.00,7.00,SPEAKER_01, Wow.
7.00,8.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
8.00,11.00,SPEAKER_02, Don't come on and tell us when the 30 minutes is about over.
11.00,12.00,SPEAKER_01, This is all free.
12.00,13.00,SPEAKER_02, Yep.
13.00,16.00,SPEAKER_02, I forgot to get my 157.
16.00,17.00,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
17.00,20.00,SPEAKER_02, Plus 30 would be 27 after one.
20.00,22.00,SPEAKER_02, Don't tell us when it starts to get over.
22.00,23.00,SPEAKER_02, It's just a deal.
23.00,26.00,SPEAKER_02, They're doing some linguistic research.
26.00,28.00,SPEAKER_02, And they sent me this packet of information.
28.00,31.00,SPEAKER_02," I read it and I said, this sounds too good to be true."
31.00,34.00,SPEAKER_01, I don't think it's sad through the school.
34.00,36.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, they sent it to the ESL program director."
36.00,37.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
37.00,45.00,SPEAKER_02," And so I got it and I read the information and I called them, you know, the place in Pennsylvania, University of Pennsylvania and I said, you know, is this on the up and up?"
45.00,48.00,SPEAKER_02," You're not going to, because they want you to enlist your students to do this."
48.00,51.00,SPEAKER_02," And plus, they're paying me 10 bucks."
51.00,52.00,SPEAKER_01, Wow.
52.00,56.00,SPEAKER_02," Anyway, I said you're not going to build them in any way."
56.00,58.00,SPEAKER_02, You're not going to call them back later.
58.00,62.00,SPEAKER_02, You're not going to give them a harassing phone calls for surveys or questions to answer anything.
62.00,65.00,SPEAKER_02," They said, nope, nope, just like it said in the paper."
65.00,67.00,SPEAKER_02, And it's all very straightforward.
67.00,77.00,SPEAKER_02, They're trying to see if computers can learn to transcribe spoken words in a bunch of different languages.
77.00,79.00,SPEAKER_02, So they're recording it.
79.00,85.00,SPEAKER_02," And what they'll do is they'll, you know, it will analyze pauses and breaks in the conversation."
85.00,93.00,SPEAKER_02," And they'll see if the computer can, the way from whatever, however they've programmed it, if it can actually pick out words."
93.00,99.00,SPEAKER_02," So that how the transcript of the conversation, if they want to look at it to see if the computer did anything that made any sense."
99.00,102.00,SPEAKER_02, But usually they don't even look at the conversation.
102.00,106.00,SPEAKER_02," So they said, any more people to why, yeah, they're not going to put me in jail."
106.00,108.00,SPEAKER_02, What am I going to say that's going to be?
108.00,109.00,SPEAKER_02, All right.
109.00,110.00,SPEAKER_02, Incriminating or anything.
110.00,111.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
111.00,112.00,SPEAKER_02, Anyway.
112.00,113.00,SPEAKER_01, How are you?
113.00,114.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm fine.
114.00,115.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, I'm tired, actually."
115.00,116.00,SPEAKER_02, I know you would be.
116.00,118.00,SPEAKER_01," I mean, it's going to long haul."
118.00,119.00,SPEAKER_02, It is.
119.00,120.00,SPEAKER_02, I know.
120.00,121.00,SPEAKER_01, And we've had some hard days.
121.00,124.00,SPEAKER_01, I've decided I don't ever really want to do a six week trip again.
124.00,126.00,SPEAKER_02, That's what everybody said at the party.
126.00,129.00,SPEAKER_02," Man, it just, you know, that's all."
129.00,130.00,SPEAKER_01, Everybody agrees.
130.00,133.00,SPEAKER_02, Two weeks is about the max that you have fun.
133.00,135.00,SPEAKER_02," You can handle three weeks, but that's it."
135.00,138.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, I thought I could even handle three."
138.00,140.00,SPEAKER_01, And four was tolerable.
140.00,142.00,SPEAKER_01, But five was just horrible.
142.00,146.00,SPEAKER_02," That's where you were held captive on the golf course, right?"
146.00,149.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, it's a, yeah, an ito."
149.00,151.00,SPEAKER_02," Ito, you didn't have any fun in ito."
151.00,153.00,SPEAKER_01, But it's no fun in ito.
153.00,154.00,SPEAKER_01, How Coney was.
154.00,157.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, you got how Coney here with the mineral baths and everything."
157.00,158.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
158.00,160.00,SPEAKER_01, And then to water was really nice.
160.00,161.00,SPEAKER_02, To water.
161.00,163.00,SPEAKER_01, It's not on the itinerary.
163.00,164.00,SPEAKER_01, I wrote you about it.
164.00,166.00,SPEAKER_01," So you get a, you get a card."
166.00,172.00,SPEAKER_01," Instead of going to a, I've time to look at the art dinner for a week, about 30 minutes."
172.00,173.00,SPEAKER_02, I've got it right here in front of me.
173.00,174.00,SPEAKER_02, Instead of going to wear.
174.00,175.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, that's what I mean."
175.00,177.00,SPEAKER_01, I have to look it up myself.
177.00,178.00,SPEAKER_02, Is that a gaea?
178.00,179.00,SPEAKER_02, Can I meet Sue?
179.00,180.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, can I meet Sue?"
180.00,182.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, can I meet you?"
182.00,184.00,SPEAKER_01, Maybe it was Jacquelyn Mochi.
184.00,186.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, wow, I'll find it."
186.00,189.00,SPEAKER_01," On the 19th, we were in Haushenoa."
189.00,190.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
190.00,193.00,SPEAKER_01," Haushenoa, I think we were going to go to a kita."
193.00,199.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, well, instead of going to a kita the first day, we went to a mountain resort called Towata."
199.00,202.00,SPEAKER_01, And that was fun.
202.00,203.00,SPEAKER_02, Yes.
203.00,205.00,SPEAKER_01," I mean, it was sort of like big bear."
205.00,207.00,SPEAKER_01," I mean, it's a big, beautiful lake in the mountains."
207.00,209.00,SPEAKER_01, And the resort was there.
209.00,211.00,SPEAKER_01, And that's all that was there.
211.00,214.00,SPEAKER_01, But Ito had a growth fest for us.
214.00,215.00,SPEAKER_02, Wow.
215.00,216.00,SPEAKER_01," I mean, he's been real nice."
216.00,218.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, you didn't write him a nice letter when you get back."
218.00,220.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, well, I've already thought I would."
220.00,222.00,SPEAKER_01, He's been real nice to us.
222.00,227.00,SPEAKER_01," We've had, well, let's see how colony we got two dinners out of him."
227.00,231.00,SPEAKER_01," And he took us to the Sapporo beer garden, and he had this fest the other night."
231.00,234.00,SPEAKER_02, And he had the pizza fest on the bus the first day.
234.00,235.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
235.00,239.00,SPEAKER_01, And Towata was real nice.
239.00,241.00,SPEAKER_01," I mean, it was a wow."
241.00,243.00,SPEAKER_01," You know, that tennis courts and all that."
243.00,244.00,SPEAKER_02, Wow.
244.00,246.00,SPEAKER_01, But I didn't play tennis.
246.00,247.00,SPEAKER_02, Did anybody else?
247.00,249.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, a couple of the guys were in this one."
249.00,254.00,SPEAKER_01," I decided, well, I don't think I'll go out and play with them, because they just really weren't that good."
254.00,257.00,SPEAKER_01," You know, they were just out of having fun."
257.00,259.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, they weren't serious tennis players."
259.00,260.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
260.00,265.00,SPEAKER_01," I thought, no, I don't want to bother working up a sweat for that."
265.00,270.00,SPEAKER_01," And anyway, that some of those things have been a lot of fun."
270.00,273.00,SPEAKER_01," You know, they'd be more fun if you were here."
273.00,274.00,SPEAKER_02, Of course.
274.00,276.00,SPEAKER_01," But I mean, we have had some fun."
276.00,279.00,SPEAKER_01, It's just that you need some fun after all this.
279.00,280.00,SPEAKER_01, You have to stay amused.
280.00,281.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
281.00,283.00,SPEAKER_02, And it's hard because it's a lovely group.
283.00,285.00,SPEAKER_02, So the novelty wears off pretty fast.
285.00,286.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
286.00,289.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, I don't even have you getting my letters and stuff?"
289.00,296.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I got a card and a letter and a two musician magazines last night when I checked in."
296.00,301.00,SPEAKER_02, Did you get anything at Sendai or a kita?
301.00,302.00,SPEAKER_01, I believe so.
302.00,304.00,SPEAKER_01, I've gotten a smile card.
304.00,306.00,SPEAKER_01, I just got that.
306.00,309.00,SPEAKER_01, And now I forget what city we've been in.
309.00,310.00,SPEAKER_01, Yesterday.
310.00,313.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, what's the name of the card?"
313.00,315.00,SPEAKER_02, What's the name of the card?
315.00,316.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
316.00,317.00,SPEAKER_01, The smile card.
317.00,318.00,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
318.00,320.00,SPEAKER_01, And I got the birch card here.
320.00,322.00,SPEAKER_01," How do you find all these things, honey?"
322.00,323.00,SPEAKER_02," I go out and look for them, dear."
323.00,324.00,SPEAKER_01, Go out and look at them.
324.00,328.00,SPEAKER_01, Do you remember the birch stand was my favorite in the goon ball?
328.00,329.00,SPEAKER_01, Of course I do.
329.00,331.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, of course you do."
331.00,332.00,SPEAKER_02, Why do you think I did that?
332.00,334.00,SPEAKER_01, I didn't think that was an accident.
334.00,335.00,SPEAKER_02, No.
335.00,336.00,SPEAKER_02, Nothing I do as an accident.
336.00,337.00,SPEAKER_01, I know.
337.00,338.00,SPEAKER_01, I know.
338.00,339.00,SPEAKER_01, Love you for that.
339.00,340.00,SPEAKER_02, I do.
340.00,343.00,SPEAKER_02, And I picked them out so they helped you stay entertained or amused.
343.00,344.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
344.00,346.00,SPEAKER_01, And I got my co-set card.
346.00,349.00,SPEAKER_01," That was just a few days ago, I guess too."
349.00,357.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, from now on, everything's going to the Tokyo, Meridian Pacific, the Osaka Hilton, or the Nagoya."
357.00,359.00,SPEAKER_02, I sent you something in Nagoya too.
359.00,360.00,SPEAKER_01, That's all we have left.
360.00,362.00,SPEAKER_01, Would you send something into Osaka?
362.00,363.00,SPEAKER_02, It's already said.
363.00,365.00,SPEAKER_02, I haven't sent you anything since last Tuesday.
365.00,368.00,SPEAKER_02, I've mailed everything on the 18th as my last date of mail stuff.
368.00,371.00,SPEAKER_02, Your cards and things are still getting here in four days.
371.00,373.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, don't forget, we've got a day ahead of you."
373.00,377.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, I know, but nevertheless, why are mine taking 10 and 11?"
377.00,380.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, 4 plus 1 is 5."
380.00,382.00,SPEAKER_02, 11 plus 1 is 10.
382.00,386.00,SPEAKER_01, It will cost a lot more to send it from here.
386.00,388.00,SPEAKER_02, So that's why it comes faster?
388.00,389.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, they have a better system."
389.00,393.00,SPEAKER_01, We all know the American Post isn't very hip anymore.
393.00,395.00,SPEAKER_02," No, they call it snail meal."
395.00,396.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
396.00,400.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, just that your card of Mount Fuji is really pretty."
400.00,401.00,SPEAKER_02, Wow.
401.00,402.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
402.00,404.00,SPEAKER_02, And you said you don't know if this is the road you went up.
404.00,406.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, I don't think there's too many roads going up there, dear."
406.00,408.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, there could have been one on the other side."
408.00,409.00,SPEAKER_02, One on the other side.
409.00,411.00,SPEAKER_01, Because it didn't say from Lake Oshi.
411.00,413.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, it was from like something else."
413.00,414.00,SPEAKER_01, And I don't recall that lake.
414.00,416.00,SPEAKER_01, So there could have been two sides to it.
416.00,420.00,SPEAKER_01, But that was one of the nice things he wanted to do with take us to Fuji.
420.00,422.00,SPEAKER_01, But this is where it sort of screws up.
422.00,425.00,SPEAKER_01, And we had this big zone going through the Fuji National Park.
425.00,428.00,SPEAKER_01," It's windy roads like, you know?"
428.00,429.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, I'm talking a lot of fun."
429.00,434.00,SPEAKER_01," Yes, I'm going to take us a hell of a long time to do this 90 kilometers to Tokyo."
434.00,436.00,SPEAKER_01," I mean, like four hours or something."
436.00,438.00,SPEAKER_01, It was a horrendous day.
438.00,440.00,SPEAKER_01," Anyway, we go up Mount Fuji."
440.00,444.00,SPEAKER_01," And, okay, we get up to the top and say, okay, 30 minutes."
444.00,445.00,SPEAKER_02, Get out.
445.00,446.00,SPEAKER_02," Take your picture, get back on the bus."
446.00,447.00,SPEAKER_01, And try and get something to eat.
447.00,449.00,SPEAKER_01, Because this is also our lunch stop.
449.00,451.00,SPEAKER_01," So I mean, why did we do this?"
451.00,455.00,SPEAKER_01, But it was nice to see it up there.
455.00,457.00,SPEAKER_01, But there was no snow because it was summer.
457.00,459.00,SPEAKER_01, And you're probably just as well off.
459.00,460.00,SPEAKER_02, There was no snow.
460.00,461.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
461.00,463.00,SPEAKER_02, It would have been freezing if there had been snow.
463.00,464.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
464.00,466.00,SPEAKER_01, But I got some pictures of Fuji from the hotel.
466.00,469.00,SPEAKER_01," I mean, the weather there changes so much."
469.00,471.00,SPEAKER_01, The fog bank rolls in and out and in and out.
471.00,474.00,SPEAKER_01, And we were having dinner one night on Mr. Ito.
474.00,478.00,SPEAKER_01," And the Maynardique comes in and says, Mount Fuji is available."
478.00,479.00,SPEAKER_00, That's what?
479.00,480.00,SPEAKER_01, Available.
480.00,481.00,SPEAKER_01, Available.
481.00,486.00,SPEAKER_01, So we are already outside and look at it and thanks for picture the 10 minutes later it's gone.
486.00,488.00,SPEAKER_02, Sort of like the Matterhorn.
488.00,490.00,SPEAKER_01," Yes, exactly."
490.00,493.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, you see what they all rave about now and..."
493.00,494.00,SPEAKER_01, See what they all rave about.
494.00,495.00,SPEAKER_01, In Japan.
495.00,500.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, but I've made just little notes on my itinerary so I can recall the whole trip."
500.00,505.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, since I haven't been writing you every day, I'm forgetting the stuff that's happening that I should have you."
505.00,513.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, you didn't get my car jet to ask you to call me tomorrow because I thought that that would be when you would call because you would be getting up for work."
513.00,525.00,SPEAKER_01," But anyway, I wanted Pocking Age address because in Sendai, there is a restaurant right at the edge of the parking lot called Raman, your coach or something like that."
525.00,530.00,SPEAKER_01, And had real good geos as if everybody's name was on the wall.
530.00,531.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
531.00,534.00,SPEAKER_01, And Bill Byrne was up there and Steve Hupstata.
534.00,535.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
535.00,536.00,SPEAKER_01, And now we signed some stuff too.
536.00,539.00,SPEAKER_01," But anyway, I just was reading them one night and said, there's Pocking Age."
539.00,540.00,SPEAKER_02, Pocking Age?
540.00,544.00,SPEAKER_01," From 1983, he was with Paul Moria."
544.00,549.00,SPEAKER_01," And so I wrote Andrei a car, but then I realized his name is in my book."
549.00,550.00,SPEAKER_01, I didn't transfer that.
550.00,553.00,SPEAKER_01, So I want to get that while we got you 30 minutes.
553.00,554.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
554.00,555.00,SPEAKER_02, I've got it.
555.00,556.00,SPEAKER_02, You ready?
556.00,557.00,, Yeah.
557.00,559.00,SPEAKER_02, Andrei Pocking Age?
559.00,561.00,SPEAKER_02, 43 Ru de Placier.
561.00,564.00,SPEAKER_01, Ru de Placier.
564.00,567.00,SPEAKER_01, P-L-E-S-S-I-E-R-S.
567.00,570.00,SPEAKER_02, 77730.
570.00,572.00,SPEAKER_02, 773.
572.00,573.00,, 773.
573.00,574.00,SPEAKER_01, So.
574.00,575.00,SPEAKER_02, Do I write?
575.00,578.00,SPEAKER_01, V-L-O-R-A-X and Gravani.
578.00,579.00,SPEAKER_02, Yep.
579.00,580.00,SPEAKER_02, V-I-L-L-A-R-E.
580.00,581.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
581.00,582.00,SPEAKER_01, Great.
582.00,583.00,SPEAKER_01, I'll send in this card.
583.00,584.00,SPEAKER_02, France.
584.00,585.00,SPEAKER_02, France.
585.00,586.00,SPEAKER_01, France.
586.00,587.00,SPEAKER_01, I know where that is.
587.00,588.00,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
