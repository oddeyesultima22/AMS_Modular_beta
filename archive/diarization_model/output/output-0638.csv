122.00,141.00,SPEAKER_00," And I guess Felipe called to over there to talk to Lee Roy. Oh. And then when we came back from the fourth of July, Felipe was like waiting at our house for Lee Roy. Mm-hmm. And, um, and for since then, they've been like going out again. Oh. And then, um, he just moved in with him."
141.00,146.00,SPEAKER_00," I guess Felipe was bothering him about, about moving in. Yeah."

165.00,171.00,SPEAKER_00," Cause they were like both angry and like, stuff. This isn't a good time. They just like pushed me out. Uh-huh."
171.00,178.00,SPEAKER_00," I was like, okay. I haven't talked to him since then. I don't know. But there I was getting in the stupid little fight. So I don't know."
178.00,188.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, that's too bad. Yeah. So who are you living with right now? It's just me and Henry now. Uh-huh."
188.00,197.00,SPEAKER_00," Um, I, uh, we only have until the 31st year. Uh-huh. Because, um, well, Henry's been the last biggest in battle."
197.00,205.00,SPEAKER_00," Uh-huh. And Lee Roy will move in with Felipe. So, right. And Lee, I already got another apartment for when I move out."
205.00,212.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, you did. Yeah. Where? It's on the corner of Columbia in Cole. Uh-huh. And it's one bedroom."
212.00,220.00,SPEAKER_00," And so I had to put down like a deposit and, um, you know, I'm paid the rent for it. So I could hold it. Mm-hmm."
220.00,227.00,SPEAKER_00," That's okay. Oh, good. Then I wouldn't have to, you know, all the people I'm looking for houses now. Yeah."
227.00,232.00,SPEAKER_00," You know, sure they are. Well, that's good."
232.00,243.00,SPEAKER_00," So what have you been doing other than work? Um, that really much of any hick. Um, I usually, I just come home from work and like stay home."
243.00,251.00,SPEAKER_00," I don't know. We haven't done much. Uh-huh. We went Santa Fe. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Me and Henry."
251.00,259.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, that's cool. Yeah, but otherwise, it's been kind of boring somewhere. Mm-hmm. Like, there'll be a tear at this like Henry and me."
259.00,267.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah. It's been boring for me too. But, maybe some saving money, I guess."
267.00,273.00,SPEAKER_00," Hmm. When are you coming back? The 19th? Oh. When does school fit? The 22nd? Oh, okay."
273.00,280.00,SPEAKER_00, I don't even know. I just knew it was around the 20th. Yeah. I think it's the 22nd.
280.00,288.00,SPEAKER_00," Mm-hmm. But. Yeah. Have you talked to me? Um, yes. I haven't talked to him since I think it's the 20th."
288.00,296.00,SPEAKER_00," Um, I've talked to him since I think like Tuesday. Mm-hmm. But he's coming back to Albuquerque tomorrow. Oh, yes. Yeah. I thought he was going to fill it up. Yeah."
296.00,305.00,SPEAKER_00," No. No. He doesn't have the money. Oh, okay. And then I couldn't get off work. Oh. So if he came, then like I would still have to go work. Oh, okay."
305.00,316.00,SPEAKER_00," So we decided that that was a waste. Because when he went to Oregon, he told me that he was not going to be back until like August because he was going to like visit you. Yeah."
316.00,327.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, that was originally the plan, but then like apparently my mom agreed that I would work for this place for exactly three months. Like, and I didn't know that."
327.00,335.00,SPEAKER_00, So I'm required to work until the 16th. Oh. So. It's kind of a bummer.
335.00,342.00,SPEAKER_00, I'm not talking about it. You guys are staying in the house right? Yeah. Yeah. That's what we said. I forgot. But who's going to live with you?
342.00,351.00,SPEAKER_00," I don't know. I was hoping it was going to be you. Oh, but. Oh, well, they said that that you guys wanted to try to live by a song."
351.00,361.00,SPEAKER_00," No, that's what he wanted. Oh, okay. Can you tell me because he told me that you guys, because he was moving out and then he said if I want, if I needed a place to stay, I could stay there."
361.00,369.00,SPEAKER_00," But you guys had wanted to like try and live this YouTube. Well, that was his plan and I said to him, no, I want to live with Stephanie."
369.00,378.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, really? I didn't know that I wouldn't have gotten like my apartment. Oh, really? Yeah. Oh. I'm sorry. We'll blame him."
378.00,386.00,SPEAKER_00," Maybe you can get your money back. I mean, it's in some month to month, Lee. So I'm sure. Oh, really? Yeah. How much?"
386.00,393.00,SPEAKER_00," It's two ninety five a month. Mm-hmm. Which is pretty good. Yeah, that's good for one bedroom. I might. I don't know."
393.00,398.00,SPEAKER_00," I think that I want to live by myself. Yeah. Well, you've wanted that for a while. Yeah."
398.00,406.00,SPEAKER_00," So, no, but I have. But I didn't. I wouldn't have done that if I were to know and it was like definitely that you wanted me to."
406.00,412.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, that, but I said to him, I don't know if Stephanie could live with me because I'm such a slob."
412.00,419.00,SPEAKER_00, Oh. I can't live with a Henry Lee word because there's a lot in there and they don't listen to me.
419.00,424.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, I thought you might have like gotten used to living with slobs. Oh, they were."
424.00,430.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, no, it's just that they like, I mean, I'm sure you would respect my like, cleanliness, but they don't. Yeah."
430.00,440.00,SPEAKER_00," No, I try and keep it all in my room. But what is it? And I'm going to do."
440.00,449.00,SPEAKER_00," Um, I don't know. But I know that she won't live with me because I hate John. Oh, I forgot about him. Yeah."
449.00,457.00,SPEAKER_00," I was like the last thing she said to me before I left. Oh, was that we could never live together because of him, which is fine by me. Yeah."
457.00,464.00,SPEAKER_00," Because when he comes, he comes for like three weeks. Yeah. And I would just go insane. Yeah."
464.00,471.00,SPEAKER_00, I really hate him. I had to I had to always forgot about him. I guess I cut sort of like block him down.
471.00,482.00,SPEAKER_00, I think most people do. But yeah. So that's kind of that.
482.00,492.00,SPEAKER_00," But I haven't heard from her all summer. Really? Yeah, I wrote her, but she didn't write back her birthday Thursday. So I should probably call."
492.00,504.00,SPEAKER_00," I think. I don't know. Have you talked to Nettie? No. No, I have it. We played pool with him like Saturday night."
504.00,513.00,SPEAKER_00," Uh-huh. Was her and Anders and some guy named Micah. Oh, that's oh, I know him. He's my friend, Medea's brother."
513.00,521.00,SPEAKER_00," That's Medea's brother? Yeah. Oh, wow. Yeah. It looks like he's other. I don't know if I've only seen him from afar."
521.00,532.00,SPEAKER_00," No, he looks like John Travolta, but he has like curly blonde hair. Oh, really? Yeah. He's supposed to be pretty cool. Yeah, he is. He is real nice. Yeah. Oh, that's good."
532.00,543.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, that's nice. Anders doesn't live with him, does he? No. He's like Nick's friend or something. Oh, Nick. Or what's that guy? Mais boyfriend."
544.00,550.00,SPEAKER_00," I have Nick. Yeah, Nick. And I guess like Nick and me were going to go, but they didn't. But they asked this guy."
550.00,559.00,SPEAKER_00," Micah. I don't know. Now, didn't any and Anders live together? No. Anders is living at Lincoln."
559.00,570.00,SPEAKER_00," Wesley? I don't know if he lived there before. Still with that guy, Mark. Right. Yeah. And, and then he like started living in this place on."
570.00,606.76,SPEAKER_00," There are. Oh, what like going to your house? Oh, okay. And, you know, across the street from Jefferson, Jefferson, Mil and yeah, Lily or something? Yeah, they were in one of my classes with her. Like Christine, she's kind of big. Yeah. Yeah. And then, Lil is like has blonde hair? I don't know if you know. I don't think I know about her."
606.76,616.76,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, and it's like, when did she move in there? Like in June, I think? Uh-huh. Is it nice? It's okay. It's kind of gross. Like, oh."
616.76,624.76,SPEAKER_00," It's like, watches all over the places. Oh, God. Eddie would hate that, I think. Yeah, she was going like quite creamy."
624.76,632.76,SPEAKER_00," Like, I guess what girl had it before, like didn't know how to clean like, period and it was all gross and so. Uh-huh."
632.76,643.76,SPEAKER_00," But they, we went on Saturday and they had to fit, they put new carpet and stuff. So, uh-huh. I guess it's okay. Oh, that's good."
643.76,653.76,SPEAKER_00, Yeah. The only person I talk to is Mark Deener. How many times are you talking? He calls every Thursday. Really? Yeah.
653.76,663.76,SPEAKER_00," He's so cute. I can't say no. He's gotten much better too. Oh, really? He doesn't get on my nerves. But he gets on my mom's nerves. Oh, really?"
663.76,671.76,SPEAKER_00," Because when she enters the phone, he like wants to talk to her for like a half an hour. And if she's always like, I have to go. I have to go."
671.76,679.76,SPEAKER_00," Typical Mark. So, I told him that my mom's like afraid of the telephone and she doesn't like the dog."
679.76,689.76,SPEAKER_00," But, he's the only one. Yeah."
689.76,699.76,SPEAKER_00, Does anyone hang out with Susie? No. No. That's good. I guess I guess little Phillipa stay in that your house.
699.76,705.76,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, I heard that when you happen. Yeah, and I bet she loves that. Oh, yeah."
705.76,715.76,SPEAKER_00," Every time I ask, can I see my kinkles all the time? Uh-huh. And he's like, she never leaves the house. All she does is bitch."
715.76,727.76,SPEAKER_00, But it's so true. He said that she just goes for a bike ride and then stays home like the rest of the day.
727.76,731.76,SPEAKER_00, Yeah. Why am I not surprised? Yeah.
731.76,736.76,SPEAKER_00," That's when I was thinking of who I was going to call because he had this phone call is free. Oh, I did. Yeah."
736.76,743.76,SPEAKER_00," So, he can talk as long as we want. Well, it's supposed to turn off as 15 minutes. I think the whole thing is screwy."
743.76,750.76,SPEAKER_00," But, you know, my dad was like, why you call Susie? I was like, that is the last person I want to talk to."
750.76,760.76,SPEAKER_00," For 15 minutes. I mean, I talked to her like three weeks ago. And all she did was bitch. Then I never paid some phone bill."
760.76,768.76,SPEAKER_00," Which I did. Then she just forgot because she spent the money on something else. And I was just like, whatever."
768.76,774.76,SPEAKER_00," She's totally messy. If she like ends up trying to stay, I'm going to have a nurse break down."
774.76,780.76,SPEAKER_00," And all I think she's already determined to leave is, yeah. But it's just like her the last minute be too lazy."
780.76,786.76,SPEAKER_00," Right. To go through with it. You know, I mean, it's just generally speaking her personality."
786.76,794.76,SPEAKER_00, Yeah. She was telling me she was going to move out last January. And she was too lazy to do it.
794.76,808.76,SPEAKER_00," So, maybe Felipe will drive her out. Oh, god, I can't fander. And she was like, bitchin that lace didn't buy cat food before he left."
808.76,815.76,SPEAKER_00," But he like fed her cat while she was away that home on the June. Yeah. You know, if she's just such a weirdo."
815.76,823.76,SPEAKER_00, This is totally crazy. I've never met a more strange person in my life.
823.76,831.76,SPEAKER_00, I know. And she seemed so like normal from the outside. Yeah. But she's really not. Yeah.
831.76,840.76,SPEAKER_00, She's one of the most unpleasant people I've ever met. I've been tempted several times to call her up and ask her if I can use her ID.
840.76,850.76,SPEAKER_00, But I would doubt that she would love. I think she gets like so stressed. Yeah. You know. And then you'd owe her for the rest of your life. Yeah.
850.76,857.76,SPEAKER_00," That's the thing. The minute she does you a favor, she'll remind you three years later. Yeah, that's why I didn't ask her."
857.76,862.76,SPEAKER_00," Cause I could pass her here. Oh, I think you could."
862.76,874.76,SPEAKER_00, Yeah. I'll just have to work on the fake ID thing. I guess. I lost my other one. Yeah. But you're on one. Looks real good. Yeah. I just have to. I haven't had a chance.
874.76,880.76,SPEAKER_00, Not that it's that important. Right.
880.76,893.76,SPEAKER_00," But soon enough, have you seen proxy? I saw her once and I said hi to her at Kinko, but then that was a one time ago."
893.76,899.76,SPEAKER_00," And apparently she and Georgia having problems. Oh, really? One thing."
