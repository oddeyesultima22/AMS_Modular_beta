0.00,2.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm not gonna hang up.
2.00,4.00,SPEAKER_01, Is that what I'm talking to you?
4.00,7.00,SPEAKER_02," Wow, so what's going on? How is your wedding?"
7.00,9.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, this is just such a great idea with this phone today."
9.00,10.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm so happy.
10.00,14.00,SPEAKER_01," So, the wedding was fantastic."
14.00,15.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, I figured it would be."
15.00,17.00,SPEAKER_01, It was really great fun.
17.00,20.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, start off at the beginning, how was the dress, how did it come out?"
20.00,21.00,SPEAKER_01, The dress came out great.
21.00,26.00,SPEAKER_01," It was really flowy like I wanted it to be really comfortable, but it looked really fancy."
26.00,29.00,SPEAKER_02," It was a nice material, right?"
29.00,31.00,SPEAKER_02, Like you bought real silk and stuff.
31.00,35.00,SPEAKER_01," It was a sand that was real, it was a charmoo's sand."
35.00,43.00,SPEAKER_01, It was really flowy and it had really nice lace on the front and a slit up the side.
43.00,45.00,SPEAKER_01, It was just really comfortable.
45.00,47.00,SPEAKER_01," There was no train, it wasn't dragging on the ground."
47.00,51.00,SPEAKER_01, And I have paid less shoes when I'm bought.
51.00,53.00,SPEAKER_03, It was pretty funny.
53.00,57.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, the whole thing came out much cheaper than it would have been to buy one in all day."
57.00,59.00,SPEAKER_02," I don't know, well yeah, of course."
59.00,62.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, and this way you got it exactly what you want to see."
62.00,63.00,SPEAKER_01," Yep, that looks great."
63.00,70.00,SPEAKER_01," And we had a formal, pretty formal ceremony even though it was, you know, liberal, but"
70.00,71.00,SPEAKER_02, I had it at the church.
71.00,76.00,SPEAKER_01," Pretty short, yeah. With my cousin and my apron."
76.00,79.00,SPEAKER_01, Apron from our floor.
79.00,82.00,SPEAKER_01, And then Kevin was the best man.
82.00,85.00,SPEAKER_02, And did you know the reverend in everything?
85.00,90.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, he's my back to him before about the ceremony and got what you wanted and all that kind of stuff."
90.00,92.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, we had like a meeting."
92.00,95.00,SPEAKER_01, He had a meeting with him.
95.00,98.00,SPEAKER_01, And the ceremony was like multiple choice.
98.00,103.00,SPEAKER_01," I gave you this thing where he had the different parts of it, like the welcome and the the pandemic."
103.00,108.00,SPEAKER_01," And this and that you pick like a, you know, part A for this and part C for that or we don't like any of these."
108.00,110.00,SPEAKER_01, We're going to put in our own.
110.00,112.00,SPEAKER_01, So it worked out really well.
112.00,113.00,SPEAKER_01, The ceremony was great.
113.00,116.00,SPEAKER_01, And then we went out in the garden and the back of the church.
116.00,120.00,SPEAKER_02," Right with Jim, not being part of a universe."
120.00,121.00,SPEAKER_02, I can't remember.
121.00,122.00,SPEAKER_02, Unitarian.
122.00,123.00,SPEAKER_01," No, it doesn't matter."
123.00,124.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, okay."
124.00,125.00,SPEAKER_02, That's good.
125.00,127.00,SPEAKER_01, Unitarian will marry anybody.
127.00,131.00,SPEAKER_01, A lot of people who come from two different religions go there.
131.00,132.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, yeah."
132.00,133.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, okay."
133.00,134.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
134.00,137.00,SPEAKER_01, So that was wonderful.
137.00,141.00,SPEAKER_02, And then what was the reception like?
141.00,155.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, we went out into the garden and sort of had an informal receiving line and then everybody went up to North Park and changed clothes and we played softball and volleyball and four square and dancing and music and great food."
155.00,157.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, that sounds like a lot of fun."
157.00,158.00,SPEAKER_01, It was.
158.00,160.00,SPEAKER_02, It sounds like it was great.
160.00,163.00,SPEAKER_01," And everybody, a lot of people told us it was the best wedding they'd ever been to."
163.00,166.00,SPEAKER_01, And I guess the highest compliment.
166.00,168.00,SPEAKER_02, Wow.
168.00,171.00,SPEAKER_02," So, did you guys go on a honeymoon?"
171.00,175.00,SPEAKER_01, Went on honeymoon to this island off the coast of Puerto Rico.
175.00,176.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, come on."
176.00,179.00,SPEAKER_01, The hardest part was getting there.
179.00,181.00,SPEAKER_01," I mean, you had to take three planes to get there."
181.00,188.00,SPEAKER_01, But we got this book from my mom about the Caribbean and I'd always wanted to go to the Caribbean.
188.00,189.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, we only went for five days."
189.00,191.00,SPEAKER_01, It was pretty short.
191.00,194.00,SPEAKER_01, But the place was totally laid back.
194.00,204.00,SPEAKER_01," It was this old plantation house that had his 24 rooms and they said in the book, like, you won't be able to tell the guests from the staff."
204.00,207.00,SPEAKER_01," And it was really, really cool."
207.00,209.00,SPEAKER_01," And they have, you know, Ms. Matt Sheets and stuff."
209.00,211.00,SPEAKER_01," It wasn't fancy at all, but it was really cheap."
211.00,214.00,SPEAKER_01, And they just had the bar open all the time.
214.00,217.00,SPEAKER_01, You could go and get whatever you wanted and just ride it on your guest ticket.
217.00,221.00,SPEAKER_01, They picked fresh mangoes from the yard for breakfast and stuff.
221.00,222.00,SPEAKER_01, It was great.
222.00,223.00,SPEAKER_02, Wow.
223.00,224.00,SPEAKER_02, Sounds ideal.
224.00,225.00,SPEAKER_01, It was really tiny.
225.00,228.00,SPEAKER_01, So the island is only 10 miles long.
228.00,234.00,SPEAKER_01," But it was good because it, you know, I reduced the English and yet it's still pretty exotic."
234.00,236.00,SPEAKER_01, It went snorkeling.
236.00,238.00,SPEAKER_01, I thought it's time to create.
238.00,239.00,SPEAKER_02, That's one thing.
239.00,240.00,SPEAKER_02, I really regret it.
240.00,241.00,SPEAKER_02, Isn't Norman I didn't have a honeymoon.
241.00,244.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, well, you should go on one anyway."
244.00,249.00,SPEAKER_02," We were planning on going on one of these days, but I don't know now what's going to happen."
249.00,255.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, you just have to say, I know I think it would be really funny if we go right now and tell people we're going on our honeymoon."
255.00,257.00,SPEAKER_01, How big are you?
257.00,260.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, actually I've only gained four pounds."
260.00,261.00,SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh.
261.00,265.00,SPEAKER_02," Which is not a lot for, you know, for how far I am."
265.00,267.00,SPEAKER_02, But I'm definitely pregnant.
267.00,273.00,SPEAKER_02," I'm going to have all the, you know, I need to give myself the extra support when I get up."
273.00,281.00,SPEAKER_02," You know, like, you know how, when you're, you know, like, when I get up, like, you know, like, how, why do you put your feet apart when you get up?"
281.00,282.00,SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh.
282.00,288.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, I have to probably put my feet like five inches for their apartment kind of hoist myself up going to the same."
288.00,289.00,SPEAKER_02, Uh-huh.
289.00,290.00,SPEAKER_02, It's pretty funny.
290.00,294.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, I'm definitely pregnant, but I'm not huge by any means."
294.00,295.00,SPEAKER_02, But where are you?
295.00,296.00,SPEAKER_01, Five and a half months now?
296.00,302.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, so it's, it's just starting to get into the part where you start to show and start to get big and the whole thing."
302.00,310.00,SPEAKER_02," But it's weird, like, you go like, like, I'm not fatter in anywhere."
310.00,311.00,SPEAKER_03, Uh-huh.
311.00,312.00,SPEAKER_02, My stomach.
312.00,317.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, it honestly looks like I swallowed, I mean, it's really weird, like, to be."
317.00,324.00,SPEAKER_02," I've never really like been a close to a pregnant wound before, you know, like I've seen them at the gym and stuff like that."
324.00,329.00,SPEAKER_02, But never had a good friend that lived close by that was pregnant that I could like actually look at her.
329.00,330.00,SPEAKER_03, Uh-huh.
330.00,333.00,SPEAKER_02, But you can see the line of your uterus.
333.00,335.00,SPEAKER_02, You can see in your stomach where it is.
335.00,339.00,SPEAKER_02, It's like this big circle and it sticks out and that makes her go home.
339.00,343.00,SPEAKER_01," And it's filling up with a daily, an alien version."
343.00,345.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, and that's totally what it feels like."
345.00,346.00,SPEAKER_01, Really?
346.00,347.00,SPEAKER_02, Does it move around?
347.00,348.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, yeah, he kicks a lot."
348.00,350.00,SPEAKER_02," I don't know that it's a he, but I call him he."
350.00,351.00,SPEAKER_02, He kicks a lot.
351.00,354.00,SPEAKER_02, He's been kicking for about five weeks now.
354.00,355.00,SPEAKER_02, Uh-huh.
355.00,357.00,SPEAKER_02, But he just started this week.
357.00,359.00,SPEAKER_02, He started rolling that I can feel.
359.00,361.00,SPEAKER_02, And they rolled a whole time.
361.00,364.00,SPEAKER_02, But now I can feel him rolling and it's totally bizarre.
364.00,369.00,SPEAKER_01," Do you have a name for, I mean like a, you know, a joke name that he calls it?"
369.00,371.00,SPEAKER_02," No, I've heard some really good ones."
371.00,372.00,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
372.00,375.00,SPEAKER_02, The only one that I came up with was Spumper because he just kicks so much.
375.00,377.00,SPEAKER_02, He's probably an active baby.
377.00,378.00,SPEAKER_00, That's good.
378.00,379.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
379.00,380.00,SPEAKER_02, Healthy.
380.00,383.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, also the monster child is the other thing I call him."
383.00,386.00,SPEAKER_00, The first Rosemary baby.
386.00,391.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, um, if he kicks that much, it's really, you know, it's really annoying."
391.00,392.00,SPEAKER_00, Is it way too up?
392.00,394.00,SPEAKER_02," No, he hasn't woken me up yet."
394.00,397.00,SPEAKER_02," But if I wake up in the middle of the night, he does kick."
397.00,400.00,SPEAKER_02, So you can feel him kicking in the middle of the night if you wake up.
400.00,402.00,SPEAKER_01, What if it's a girl?
402.00,412.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, it's probably not a girl because in our family, if you go on both sides of our family and you look at all our first cousins and everything, it's like 75% male."
412.00,414.00,SPEAKER_02, But it might be a girl.
414.00,416.00,SPEAKER_02, I was positive it was a girl.
416.00,421.00,SPEAKER_02," Like the first three months, I was absolutely positive it was a girl."
421.00,423.00,SPEAKER_02, And then I changed my mind.
423.00,426.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm sure it's a boy.
426.00,429.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, that'll be a surprise then."
429.00,430.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
430.00,432.00,SPEAKER_01, Are you going to ask them not to tell you if you're...
432.00,438.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm not having an ultrasound because it's really like we went and looked at all this research.
438.00,439.00,SPEAKER_02, There's all this stuff.
439.00,441.00,SPEAKER_02, You'll see when you get pregnant.
441.00,445.00,SPEAKER_02," If you want to know, just send me email because I looked up a bunch of stuff."
445.00,447.00,SPEAKER_02, But there's all this research like on...
447.00,450.00,SPEAKER_02, There's all different kinds of prenatal tests that you can get now.
450.00,451.00,SPEAKER_02, It's not just amnio.
451.00,453.00,SPEAKER_02, It's like other stuff too.
453.00,458.00,SPEAKER_02, And then there's also the ultrasound.
458.00,465.00,SPEAKER_02," But in fact, if you look at the latest research on ultrasound, it's like they really don't know."
465.00,470.00,SPEAKER_02, Like they assume that it's safe because they've had it for 20 years.
470.00,471.00,SPEAKER_01, And that thing's happened?
471.00,472.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, they don't know."
472.00,476.00,SPEAKER_02, They've never really done any big studies on it or anything.
476.00,484.00,SPEAKER_02," But if you're a normal, like there's reasons to have an ultrasound, and if you have to have an ultrasound, then it's a really good diagnostic tool, right?"
484.00,485.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
485.00,490.00,SPEAKER_02," But in a normal low-risk pregnancy like mine, it's not a good diagnostic tool at all."
490.00,496.00,SPEAKER_02, Like they find as many false positives as they do false negatives.
496.00,498.00,SPEAKER_01," First, why are they going to be evidence of stuff?"
498.00,505.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, the only thing they can really check, they can check the heart, and then they can check to see if the baby has a brain."
505.00,508.00,SPEAKER_00," And then they can be like, that would be a good idea."
508.00,513.00,SPEAKER_02, Then they can do some measurements to see if the baby has...
513.00,514.00,SPEAKER_00, Sex emergency.
514.00,516.00,SPEAKER_02," Like down syndrome, like sometimes..."
516.00,518.00,SPEAKER_02, But that's not really very good.
518.00,521.00,SPEAKER_02, Like amnio is the only sure way to find out.
521.00,525.00,SPEAKER_02, But it could give you like some indications that the baby might have downed or something.
525.00,529.00,SPEAKER_02, But it's really not a very good diagnostic tool at all for people with low-risk pregnancy.
529.00,531.00,SPEAKER_02, So I didn't bother getting them.
531.00,534.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, good. I'm sure everything will be fine."
534.00,538.00,SPEAKER_01," And if it's not, it's like, you know, you're going to have to be scared anyway."
538.00,540.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, if it's not, like..."
540.00,542.00,SPEAKER_02," And we didn't do any of the testing, because like..."
542.00,547.00,SPEAKER_02," I've met like three people since I got pregnant, where the baby had downs, right?"
547.00,549.00,SPEAKER_02, They found out the baby had downs.
549.00,551.00,SPEAKER_02, And they aborted it.
551.00,553.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, it's not called abortion."
553.00,555.00,SPEAKER_01, It's called termination.
555.00,556.00,SPEAKER_02, That's right.
556.00,558.00,SPEAKER_02, And I just couldn't have done that.
558.00,561.00,SPEAKER_02," We talked about it a little bit, you know what I mean?"
561.00,565.00,SPEAKER_02," Obviously, I don't want my baby to have a mental defect or anything like that."
565.00,567.00,SPEAKER_00," But if it does, you'll feel..."
567.00,568.00,SPEAKER_02, I could not have done that.
568.00,571.00,SPEAKER_02," But it wasn't worth doing the prenatal testing, because..."
571.00,575.00,SPEAKER_01," If you're not going to abort anyway, then there's no reason to have it."
575.00,581.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, there are like some conditions that they can test for that are sort of incompatible with life."
581.00,587.00,SPEAKER_02," But then I figured, well, I'll just go through the nine months of pregnancy and then the baby will die when it's born, you know?"
587.00,589.00,SPEAKER_02, It's a click.
589.00,591.00,SPEAKER_01," We had this friend, this is not supposed to scare you."
591.00,593.00,SPEAKER_01, It's just because it's on the topic.
593.00,596.00,SPEAKER_01, But the baby died at like eight and a half months.
596.00,598.00,SPEAKER_02, I know. I read so many of them.
598.00,599.00,SPEAKER_02, They just freaked me out.
599.00,602.00,SPEAKER_01, And of course they make you have give birth anyway.
602.00,603.00,SPEAKER_01, You have to do.
603.00,605.00,SPEAKER_01," I mean, that's how you have an abortion."
605.00,606.00,SPEAKER_01, You give birth.
606.00,608.00,SPEAKER_01," And instead, you know it's dead."
608.00,609.00,SPEAKER_01, It's a hassle.
609.00,612.00,SPEAKER_01, You've got to go through all that pain knowing the baby's not even alive anyway.
612.00,615.00,SPEAKER_01," But, you know, she's pregnant again."
615.00,616.00,SPEAKER_01, They're fine.
616.00,617.00,SPEAKER_02, What happened to the baby?
617.00,618.00,SPEAKER_02, They didn't know.
618.00,621.00,SPEAKER_01, I think it got either strangled by its court or some kind of...
621.00,622.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, that's what they could be."
622.00,623.00,SPEAKER_02, They always say that.
623.00,624.00,SPEAKER_01, They say they're an accident.
624.00,626.00,SPEAKER_01," It's like they didn't act in, yeah."
626.00,628.00,SPEAKER_01," You know, something happened."
628.00,637.00,SPEAKER_01, Or maybe it went into oxygen deficiency or something like something happened to her and she was asleep at the time.
637.00,640.00,SPEAKER_01, And so she didn't even know it until the next morning.
640.00,643.00,SPEAKER_01, And it's something like that.
643.00,645.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, it's been so scary."
645.00,653.00,SPEAKER_01," But obviously, you know, when you have a baby for the rest of its life and your life, you have to worry that it might die, you know, or something will happen to it."
653.00,655.00,SPEAKER_02, So scary. It's awful.
655.00,657.00,SPEAKER_01, That's gotta be the worst thing.
657.00,658.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, what is?"
658.00,660.00,SPEAKER_02, Let me know. Did you get to meet your nephew at your...
660.00,663.00,SPEAKER_01, I did. A baby Jack is huge.
663.00,665.00,SPEAKER_01, He's four months.
665.00,667.00,SPEAKER_01, And he's like 18 pounds.
667.00,668.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, my God."
668.00,669.00,SPEAKER_01, The kid is a...
669.00,670.00,SPEAKER_01, It's all that.
670.00,672.00,SPEAKER_02, He's a size of a 10-year-old.
672.00,673.00,SPEAKER_02, He's huge.
673.00,676.00,SPEAKER_01, He's the shape of a small baby.
676.00,678.00,SPEAKER_01," But, you know, he's big."
678.00,680.00,SPEAKER_01, He's heavy.
680.00,682.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, you better hope that doesn't run in the family."
682.00,684.00,SPEAKER_02, How could it be when he was born?
684.00,686.00,SPEAKER_01," He was normal, doesn't he?"
686.00,688.00,SPEAKER_01, He was born like 8 and a half pounds.
688.00,689.00,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
689.00,691.00,SPEAKER_01, But my brother...
691.00,697.00,SPEAKER_01," My uncle is like 6 foot 4 and my brother's big and on Galen's side of the family, there's big people too."
697.00,700.00,SPEAKER_01," So, I mean, he could just be big boys."
700.00,702.00,SPEAKER_02, He's a big pound.
702.00,703.00,SPEAKER_02," That is, he moneyed us."
703.00,705.00,SPEAKER_01, From breast milk alone in four months.
705.00,707.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, my God."
707.00,708.00,SPEAKER_01, And yet he's small.
708.00,710.00,SPEAKER_01," You know, he doesn't look that huge."
710.00,711.00,SPEAKER_01, He's not very long or anything.
711.00,713.00,SPEAKER_01, And he's not chevy.
713.00,714.00,SPEAKER_01, He's chevy.
714.00,715.00,SPEAKER_01, But he's...
715.00,716.00,SPEAKER_01, He just weighs.
716.00,717.00,SPEAKER_01, He's hefty.
717.00,720.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, they just tell you, feed on to me."
720.00,723.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, if they want to eat that much, you let him eat that much."
723.00,725.00,SPEAKER_01, And he's healthy and all.
725.00,727.00,SPEAKER_01," So, you know, he just like, oh, well."
727.00,728.00,SPEAKER_02, And do they seem happy and...
728.00,730.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, they're really happy."
730.00,733.00,SPEAKER_01, It was kind of stressful coming all the way out here with the little one.
733.00,734.00,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
734.00,737.00,SPEAKER_01," But when they got back, it was kind of exhausting to them."
737.00,741.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, everybody, you know, couldn't get their hands off."
741.00,743.00,SPEAKER_01," Baby, Jackie was the star of the wedding."
743.00,745.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, yeah."
745.00,747.00,SPEAKER_01, But we wanted him to be too.
747.00,750.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, you know, there's only one hand to it."
750.00,751.00,SPEAKER_01, I know.
751.00,756.00,SPEAKER_01," But I think we're going to go back to like, plan A and start trying to knock table when you're given birth."
756.00,757.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, really?"
757.00,759.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, you know, maybe."
759.00,760.00,SPEAKER_01, You never know.
760.00,763.00,SPEAKER_02, I'll call you up right before I go into labor.
763.00,764.00,SPEAKER_02," And say, now's the time."
764.00,767.00,SPEAKER_01, If my cycles are regular as they...
767.00,772.00,SPEAKER_01," As regular as they have been, then I'll be ovulating around the end of the month."
772.00,773.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, yeah."
773.00,775.00,SPEAKER_02, So it would be...
775.00,777.00,SPEAKER_02, It would be the Halloween baby.
777.00,778.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
778.00,784.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, maybe like mine would get the spirit of yours or something like the human spirit."
784.00,786.00,SPEAKER_01, So that's so weird.
786.00,789.00,SPEAKER_01," I mean, the babies are being bored every day with things."
789.00,790.00,SPEAKER_01, They're all different.
790.00,791.00,SPEAKER_01," I know, yeah."
791.00,792.00,SPEAKER_02, So what about...
792.00,794.00,SPEAKER_02, And Davidson had her baby.
794.00,795.00,SPEAKER_01, She did.
795.00,796.00,SPEAKER_02, Wow.
796.00,797.00,SPEAKER_01, Yep.
797.00,798.00,SPEAKER_01," John, I've been Davidson."
798.00,799.00,SPEAKER_02," No, I didn't really."
799.00,801.00,SPEAKER_02, She was that much more ahead of me.
801.00,803.00,SPEAKER_02," I thought she was just a few months, but I guess so."
803.00,804.00,SPEAKER_01, You had it May.
804.00,805.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, wow."
805.00,806.00,SPEAKER_02, Wow.
806.00,807.00,SPEAKER_01, It made the story.
807.00,809.00,SPEAKER_02, October's a good time when would the baby be due.
809.00,810.00,SPEAKER_02, And then you'd have it all...
810.00,811.00,SPEAKER_02, You'd been...
811.00,812.00,SPEAKER_02, You'd be pregnant.
812.00,813.00,SPEAKER_02, And then you'd have it all through the door.
813.00,814.00,SPEAKER_01, To lie.
814.00,816.00,SPEAKER_01, You'd be due this time next year.
816.00,817.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, yeah."
817.00,819.00,SPEAKER_02," And then you'd be pregnant all through the winter, so that's good."
819.00,822.00,SPEAKER_02, You should start trying earlier.
822.00,823.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, we might start trying to..."
823.00,825.00,SPEAKER_02, It's a bit too much to be pregnant in July.
825.00,828.00,SPEAKER_02, It was going to be hot wherever you're living.
828.00,831.00,SPEAKER_01, I just don't want to be too pregnant in April when an A-E-R-A is.
831.00,832.00,SPEAKER_01, I want to go to A-E-R-A.
832.00,837.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, well, in that case you have to be in your six months at A-E-R-A."
837.00,839.00,SPEAKER_00, So that's what it would be.
839.00,840.00,SPEAKER_00, That's what it would be.
840.00,842.00,SPEAKER_02," Actually, it's eight weeks."
842.00,844.00,SPEAKER_02," Bella, you travel up to eight weeks."
844.00,846.00,SPEAKER_02, So eight weeks before you're due.
846.00,847.00,SPEAKER_01, Seven months.
847.00,848.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
848.00,851.00,SPEAKER_02, So let you travel until 32 weeks.
851.00,853.00,SPEAKER_01, But it's even driving distance.
853.00,854.00,SPEAKER_01, It's in New York.
854.00,855.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, yeah."
855.00,856.00,SPEAKER_02, That's a big deal.
856.00,860.00,SPEAKER_02," And if you have a normal risk pregnancy, your doctor will let you drive until..."
860.00,861.00,SPEAKER_01, At the end.
861.00,862.00,SPEAKER_02, He'll tell 37 weeks.
862.00,864.00,SPEAKER_01, You could drive yourself to the hospital.
864.00,865.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, you can drive."
865.00,866.00,SPEAKER_01, You can drive.
866.00,870.00,SPEAKER_02, You just have to stop every two hours and get out and stretch your legs.
870.00,871.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
871.00,874.00,SPEAKER_02," And there's no reason to believe you wouldn't have a normal, low risk pregnancy."
874.00,875.00,SPEAKER_02, I know.
875.00,876.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm healthy.
876.00,881.00,SPEAKER_01," And Jim's not as healthy as I am, but I mean, for the little sperm, I don't think it matters."
881.00,885.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, if you know you want to get pregnant, now's the time to start changing your lifestyle."
885.00,886.00,SPEAKER_01, I know.
886.00,887.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, that's the other thing."
887.00,890.00,SPEAKER_02," I'm too sorry about that, but you really cannot smoke."
890.00,891.00,SPEAKER_02, I know.
891.00,892.00,SPEAKER_02, You're pregnant.
892.00,896.00,SPEAKER_02, And it's going to take a while to get used to it.
896.00,899.00,SPEAKER_02, And they do say that you can drink caffeine.
899.00,901.00,SPEAKER_02, The doctors seem to have no problem with that.
901.00,904.00,SPEAKER_02, Although I actually quit drinking caffeine when I found out.
904.00,909.00,SPEAKER_02, But you can only have like two cups a day or something like that.
909.00,914.00,SPEAKER_01, So the main thing I want to make sure that I'm off at ovulation times I'll go on then.
914.00,915.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
915.00,917.00,SPEAKER_01, Because it's right to be getting that it's sad.
917.00,920.00,SPEAKER_02, Like I would stop smoking pot a couple months before.
920.00,921.00,SPEAKER_01, I don't do that.
921.00,922.00,SPEAKER_02, Are you done?
922.00,923.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, sorry."
923.00,928.00,SPEAKER_02, And I'm such an idiot.
928.00,933.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm sorry.
933.00,936.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, yeah, I'm sorry."
936.00,940.00,SPEAKER_01," With that, I was 1, 1 said yes, 1 said I agree with you."
940.00,941.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, first and show."
941.00,942.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, so."
942.00,944.00,SPEAKER_01, Sorry.
944.00,945.00,SPEAKER_02, One tips.
945.00,947.00,SPEAKER_02, Anyhow.
947.00,953.00,SPEAKER_02," So, yeah, the other thing that they used to do is like start trying to drink more milk."
953.00,957.00,SPEAKER_02, Because you're supposed to drink four glasses a milky day when you're pregnant.
957.00,959.00,SPEAKER_02, And it's like totally impossible to do.
959.00,965.00,SPEAKER_02," But on the other hand, you know, it's so sick for the first three months that you even want milk or anything."
965.00,967.00,SPEAKER_01, didn't want milk or anything else.
967.00,971.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, no, I didn't eat anything really, but jelly beans and cookies for the first three months."
971.00,973.00,SPEAKER_02, It doesn't really matter.
973.00,974.00,SPEAKER_02, It's no big deal.
974.00,977.00,SPEAKER_02," Like you didn't have, it's a really no big deal for the first three months."
977.00,983.00,SPEAKER_02, Because basically what happens is it's totally true when you said babies like an alien he's a little parasite.
983.00,985.00,SPEAKER_01, He's just making his own nutrients up here.
985.00,986.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I'm biblical corn here."
986.00,988.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, how's stealing from you?"
988.00,998.00,SPEAKER_02," So what will happen, for instance, if you don't get enough milk when you're pregnant with the baby, it'll take the calcium from your bones and you'll end up with osteoporosis when you're an old person."
998.00,1000.00,SPEAKER_01, I'll drink milk.
1000.00,1001.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, so."
1001.00,1003.00,SPEAKER_02, And that's the same thing with protein and stuff.
1003.00,1006.00,SPEAKER_02, He'll take the protein from your muscles and...
1006.00,1007.00,SPEAKER_03, Uh-huh.
1007.00,1015.00,SPEAKER_02," So the baby, like basically what, you know, the baby doesn't really suffer that much, but the mother will suffer if she doesn't like get the red amount of nutrients and stuff."
1015.00,1021.00,SPEAKER_02," But when during the first three months, they're so small that they need such tiny, tiny amounts."
1021.00,1026.00,SPEAKER_02," When they start getting bigger, then it starts getting to be more important to eat well."
1026.00,1027.00,SPEAKER_02, Uh-huh.
1027.00,1034.00,SPEAKER_02," But also, you know, if you can exercise, because I mean, if you, well, you already exercise a lot now, so it doesn't matter."
1034.00,1042.00,SPEAKER_02," But they say don't change your habits, you know, like if you're relatively sedentary before."
1042.00,1044.00,SPEAKER_01," Right, don't go suddenly run marathons."
1044.00,1053.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, but if you run marathons before you can continue jogging until you're fifth or six months, you know, you ride your bike all the time, you can continue riding your bike."
1053.00,1055.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I remember that back in the day."
1055.00,1061.00,SPEAKER_01," And, Davidson said she jogged for the first three months, and as soon as it hit her fourth month, she had to go to walking."
1061.00,1062.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, really?"
1062.00,1069.00,SPEAKER_01," But she still like rode bike and actually decides a lot and she just gained just the right amount of weight, and it was perfect."
1069.00,1072.00,SPEAKER_02," I've totally just dependent on the person, whatever you feel."
1072.00,1076.00,SPEAKER_02," Like, I was so sick when I first got pregnant that I couldn't even walk."
1076.00,1081.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, I'd go outside and I'd go for a walk, and I'd go like five steps, and I'd feel like barfings."
1081.00,1082.00,SPEAKER_00, That's disgusting.
1082.00,1083.00,SPEAKER_00, I know.
1083.00,1084.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm impressed.
1084.00,1086.00,SPEAKER_02," Like, the person was so disgusting."
1086.00,1089.00,SPEAKER_02, The morning sick is like the most disgusting thing in the world.
1089.00,1091.00,SPEAKER_01, I was sick when I was pregnant before.
1091.00,1092.00,SPEAKER_01, I was pregnant before.
1092.00,1093.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1093.00,1094.00,SPEAKER_01, Terminated it.
1094.00,1095.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1095.00,1096.00,, But...
1096.00,1099.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, then you'll probably be sick this time, too."
1099.00,1100.00,SPEAKER_01, I know.
1100.00,1101.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, you'll probably be real."
1101.00,1102.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, it's horrible."
1102.00,1108.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, it was just like the most horrible experience in my life I cried like on the average of once a week."
1108.00,1112.00,SPEAKER_02," And I would call it like my aunt, you know, and she'd be on the phone."
1112.00,1116.00,SPEAKER_02," She'd be like laughing because she thought it was so cute, you know, hot, so funny."
1116.00,1122.00,SPEAKER_02," Then I went and visited them in my 12th week, and I didn't stop getting sick until 16, the end of my 16th week."
1122.00,1125.00,SPEAKER_02," Actually, I still get sick, but it's not so bad."
1125.00,1126.00,SPEAKER_02," But, um..."
1126.00,1129.00,SPEAKER_02," So, and then I went and visited them, right?"
1129.00,1133.00,SPEAKER_02," And then she saw what I was like, and then she apologized for laughing, you know?"
1133.00,1134.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, God."
1134.00,1136.00,SPEAKER_00," See, I was like, I don't..."
1136.00,1139.00,SPEAKER_00," I'm like, dude, go like, no, what is like that, but I will."
1139.00,1140.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, it's Mr. Ball."
1140.00,1141.00,SPEAKER_02, It's really...
1141.00,1144.00,SPEAKER_00, So how's Norm doing about thinking about being a father?
1144.00,1145.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, I don't know."
1145.00,1147.00,SPEAKER_02," We don't really, you know, he..."
1147.00,1156.00,SPEAKER_02," He seems to have accepted it pretty well, but I don't think he really has much clue about what it's going to be like, because like, I was talking the other day, you know, he's working now, so um..."
1156.00,1157.00,SPEAKER_00, What's he doing?
1157.00,1160.00,SPEAKER_02," He's working at BNR, he's doing inter-faced design stuff."
1160.00,1161.00,SPEAKER_01, That's great.
1161.00,1168.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, that's the same kind of job like I sent you the Microsoft post, but it's a local job."
1168.00,1174.00,SPEAKER_02," So, anyhow, he's not really going to have much time when the baby gets more than like maybe he'll have a few days off."
1174.00,1178.00,SPEAKER_02," So, he's talking about how he's going to have to sleep in a separate room, you know?"
1178.00,1180.00,SPEAKER_02, Because he wasn't going to have time off.
1180.00,1183.00,SPEAKER_02," He's like, well, why are you going to have to sleep in a separate room?"
1183.00,1185.00,SPEAKER_02," He didn't really have the concept that, you know..."
1185.00,1187.00,SPEAKER_02, It was waking up all night.
1187.00,1193.00,SPEAKER_00," But he can just wake up and go back to sleep, you know?"
1193.00,1194.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, some people do."
1194.00,1201.00,SPEAKER_02," Like, I was talking to him, one of my friends here at work, and he said that, you know, after the first week, the baby never woke him up at night."
1201.00,1204.00,SPEAKER_02," He just slept through the whole thing, and first we'll have the baby."
1204.00,1207.00,SPEAKER_02," Then you'll see when you get pregnant, there's all these like..."
1207.00,1212.00,SPEAKER_02," Is the baby sleep with you, or sleep in its own bed, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
1212.00,1214.00,SPEAKER_01, All kinds of decisions.
1214.00,1216.00,SPEAKER_01," The rest of it's life, you're kind of deciding, okay?"
1216.00,1217.00,SPEAKER_01, I know.
1217.00,1223.00,SPEAKER_01," Are you going to allow it to do this, and if you're the right kind of friends, or should you warn them, or should you let them make them a statement?"
1223.00,1224.00,SPEAKER_01, No!
1224.00,1225.00,SPEAKER_02, I know.
1225.00,1230.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, and given my experience, I started to know all the tricks and books, too."
1230.00,1232.00,SPEAKER_00," You'll see a great mom, see?"
1232.00,1235.00,SPEAKER_00," I don't worry, just relax and have a good time with it."
1235.00,1238.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, yeah, I'm not really concerned at all."
1238.00,1241.00,SPEAKER_02," I'm not making any decisions or anything, because it's so hard to know what you're going to do."
1241.00,1249.00,SPEAKER_02," I know, like, lots of people said they were going to breastfeed, and then it turns out they couldn't breastfeed, or..."
1249.00,1251.00,SPEAKER_01," You're going to breastfeed, aren't you?"
1251.00,1253.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, I'm going to try."
1253.00,1255.00,SPEAKER_02," It's hard, it's not easy."
1255.00,1259.00,SPEAKER_02," But, you know, if you have the right kind of support, then you can."
1259.00,1261.00,SPEAKER_02, There's this thing called La Lecci Lea.
1261.00,1262.00,SPEAKER_01," Right, I'm sure of that."
1262.00,1270.00,SPEAKER_02," I'm going to go to La Lecci Lea meetings, and you can get like, lactation consultants, and there's some hard for a couple of months."
1270.00,1273.00,SPEAKER_01," Just my research the whole thing, girl."
1273.00,1281.00,SPEAKER_02," Then you have to decide whether you want to midwife, or a doctor, and then you can get like, labor coaches."
1281.00,1282.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh my God, you have no idea."
1282.00,1285.00,SPEAKER_02," And then there's like different methods of birth, you know?"
1285.00,1287.00,SPEAKER_01," You know, it sounds like me."
1287.00,1289.00,SPEAKER_01, It sounds like just like learning how to do a wedding.
1289.00,1293.00,SPEAKER_01, It was all these different new categories that I'd never heard of before.
1293.00,1294.00,SPEAKER_02," So, absolutely."
1294.00,1296.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, I'm sure it's the exact same thing."
1296.00,1301.00,SPEAKER_01," Except that that was like, just a big party, and I have had those before, but I've never had a baby before."
1301.00,1302.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1302.00,1305.00,SPEAKER_01, What I have to remember is my training from Girl Scouts.
1305.00,1313.00,SPEAKER_01," We took this special course in my Girl Scouts, and we were like 12 or 13 that was for baby sitting."
1313.00,1315.00,SPEAKER_01, It was like a little certificate that you got at the end.
1315.00,1320.00,SPEAKER_01," But it taught you to stuff, you know, first aid, or what to do if it's strange, you're coming to the door, and you know, all kinds of stuff."
1320.00,1327.00,SPEAKER_02, I held a seven week old for like the first time in about probably 20 years.
1327.00,1328.00,SPEAKER_02, Over the weekend.
1328.00,1329.00,SPEAKER_02, Really?
1329.00,1330.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, it was pretty funny."
1330.00,1333.00,SPEAKER_02, First time in 20 years since you babysat.
1333.00,1336.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, it was a seven week old."
1336.00,1338.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, that's a really pretty stuff."
1338.00,1339.00,SPEAKER_00, Pretty young.
1339.00,1340.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1340.00,1341.00,SPEAKER_02, It was pretty funny.
1341.00,1346.00,SPEAKER_02," I was like totally inept and absolutely cannot hold it, but, oh, well."
1346.00,1350.00,SPEAKER_01," John, I held John at the time when he was 10 days old on Mother's Day."
1350.00,1353.00,SPEAKER_01, I went out there and I had to see him first day.
1353.00,1365.00,SPEAKER_01," And now, and then Liz Bob's editor, Liz, she brought her baby into the first time."
1365.00,1367.00,SPEAKER_01, She's four months old too.
1367.00,1369.00,SPEAKER_01, She's the same age as my nephew.
1369.00,1372.00,SPEAKER_01," I mean, I'm about to have her with us."
1372.00,1374.00,SPEAKER_02, What's she pregnant?
1374.00,1375.00,SPEAKER_01, She was pregnant.
1375.00,1376.00,SPEAKER_01, She didn't show for quite a while.
1376.00,1380.00,SPEAKER_01, She didn't show until like six months and then she started showing all of a sudden and just went boom.
1380.00,1382.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, that's what happens like with first babies."
1382.00,1383.00,SPEAKER_02, That's something like that.
1383.00,1384.00,SPEAKER_02, That was the second baby.
1384.00,1385.00,SPEAKER_02, That was even new.
1385.00,1386.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, well, that's surprising."
1386.00,1388.00,SPEAKER_02, Because usually second baby show really early.
1388.00,1390.00,SPEAKER_01, She maybe she just wore loose clothing.
1390.00,1391.00,SPEAKER_01, I don't know.
1391.00,1392.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1392.00,1393.00,SPEAKER_02, Wow.
1393.00,1394.00,SPEAKER_01," But, yeah, she had a girl."
1394.00,1396.00,SPEAKER_01, She had a boy before and then she had to go too.
1396.00,1397.00,SPEAKER_01, And that's perfect.
1397.00,1398.00,SPEAKER_02, Wow.
1398.00,1400.00,SPEAKER_01, That's what I once wanted to eat.
1400.00,1402.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, that's what I'd like to."
1402.00,1403.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1403.00,1404.00,SPEAKER_02, Wow.
1404.00,1407.00,SPEAKER_01, It was pretty experience of raising both genders.
1407.00,1408.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1408.00,1409.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1409.00,1410.00,SPEAKER_02, I don't care.
1410.00,1411.00,SPEAKER_02, Whatever I get.
1411.00,1411.96,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, whatever."
1411.96,1412.96,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
1412.96,1415.96,SPEAKER_02," And the one here, it would also be nice to have two kids of the same gender."
1415.96,1416.96,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1416.96,1419.96,SPEAKER_02, Because then they could just be more...
1419.96,1420.96,SPEAKER_02, I don't know.
1420.96,1423.96,SPEAKER_02, But what's going on with work?
1423.96,1424.96,SPEAKER_02, How's everyone there?
1424.96,1425.96,SPEAKER_01, Oh man.
1425.96,1427.96,SPEAKER_01," So, well, everybody's gone."
1427.96,1428.96,SPEAKER_01, We lost Kathy.
1428.96,1429.96,SPEAKER_01, We lost Jen.
1429.96,1431.96,SPEAKER_01, Our undergraduate research assistant.
1431.96,1436.96,SPEAKER_01, We lost the gratitude that we of GAYA's that we had as a research assistant.
1436.96,1437.96,SPEAKER_02, Why is everybody leaving?
1437.96,1438.96,SPEAKER_02, Is too much stress or just...
1438.96,1441.96,SPEAKER_01, You got better jobs than quit.
1441.96,1446.96,SPEAKER_00, That's literally the truth.
1446.96,1447.96,SPEAKER_00, All three of them.
1447.96,1448.96,SPEAKER_01, Wow.
1448.96,1449.96,SPEAKER_01, Got better jobs.
1449.96,1451.96,SPEAKER_01," So, it's Brita and Meen Ann."
1451.96,1452.96,SPEAKER_01, Wow.
1452.96,1453.96,SPEAKER_02, That sucks.
1453.96,1454.96,SPEAKER_02, Wow.
1454.96,1455.96,SPEAKER_01, That sucks.
1455.96,1456.96,SPEAKER_01, And my thing's up August 15th.
1456.96,1457.96,SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh.
1457.96,1458.96,SPEAKER_02, But now she's...
1458.96,1461.96,SPEAKER_02," No, Ann should have money from Kathy's that she can use."
1461.96,1462.96,SPEAKER_01, She has...
1462.96,1464.96,SPEAKER_01, Brita is going to have Kathy's jobs.
1464.96,1466.96,SPEAKER_01, She's going to hire someone else as a research assistant.
1466.96,1469.96,SPEAKER_01," So that leaves the postdoc salary that we have, which is half time."
1469.96,1470.96,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
1470.96,1474.96,SPEAKER_01, So I'm going to be half time through November probably.
1474.96,1476.96,SPEAKER_01," And then, oh, we are, Ann."
1476.96,1477.96,SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh.
1477.96,1478.96,SPEAKER_01, And Ann needs...
1478.96,1480.96,SPEAKER_01, As a postdoc wanting to pay her own salary.
1480.96,1481.96,SPEAKER_01," So, wow."
1481.96,1487.96,SPEAKER_01," So, she won't get a postdoc because she doesn't have anything else to make up the rest of her salary."
1487.96,1488.96,SPEAKER_01, But she's got another grant in.
1488.96,1489.96,SPEAKER_01," And so, she gets that."
1489.96,1490.96,SPEAKER_01, Then she will get to have a postdoc.
1490.96,1491.96,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
1491.96,1493.96,SPEAKER_01," You know, it's all up in the air."
1493.96,1494.96,SPEAKER_01, But we're just going to try to stay here.
1494.96,1497.96,SPEAKER_01, During the lobbying for a raise.
1497.96,1498.96,SPEAKER_03, Uh-huh.
1498.96,1500.96,SPEAKER_01," Because, man, Walghemite or companies, booming."
1500.96,1503.96,SPEAKER_01, And he doesn't pay his people anything.
1503.96,1505.96,SPEAKER_02, Yeah. Yeah. Jim should get paid more.
1505.96,1507.96,SPEAKER_02," I mean, I'm sure he's not making enough."
1507.96,1508.96,SPEAKER_01, He's not making nearly enough.
1508.96,1510.96,SPEAKER_01, And neither are the rest of the people who work there.
1510.96,1511.96,SPEAKER_01, They're all going to demand a raise.
1511.96,1514.96,SPEAKER_01, But he's going to start looking for another job he says.
1514.96,1515.96,SPEAKER_02, Uh-huh.
1515.96,1517.96,SPEAKER_02, Do you guys want to stay in Pittsburgh?
1517.96,1518.96,SPEAKER_02, Or do you want to leave?
1518.96,1522.96,SPEAKER_01," Well, if things work out, then, you know, it would be nice to stay here for now."
1522.96,1523.96,SPEAKER_01, Because we've got this chief place to live.
1523.96,1524.96,SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh.
1524.96,1525.96,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1525.96,1535.96,SPEAKER_01, We have a huge place that we could downsize even and pay less than we're paying now.
1535.96,1537.96,SPEAKER_01, And we're perfectly comfortably.
1537.96,1538.96,SPEAKER_01, Or buy place.
1538.96,1540.96,SPEAKER_01, A small place.
1540.96,1541.96,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1541.96,1542.96,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1542.96,1543.96,SPEAKER_02, You could easily buy a place.
1543.96,1544.96,SPEAKER_01, And which you can't hear most of these.
1544.96,1553.96,SPEAKER_02," You don't know what the thing is is that if you get a job and then you get pregnant right away, you're going to be able to go to half time."
1553.96,1560.96,SPEAKER_02," But, you know, if you get a job, you have to work at a place for over a year before you're even allowed six weeks maternity leave."
1560.96,1562.96,SPEAKER_01, So are you basically quitting on the baby's form?
1562.96,1563.96,SPEAKER_02, No.
1563.96,1565.96,SPEAKER_02, I get six months maternity leave.
1565.96,1566.96,SPEAKER_01, You get six months?
1566.96,1567.96,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1567.96,1568.96,SPEAKER_02, I get six months.
1568.96,1570.96,SPEAKER_02, And four of those months will be at full pay.
1570.96,1571.96,SPEAKER_01, Wow.
1571.96,1574.96,SPEAKER_02, And because those months will be at 65% of pay.
1574.96,1575.96,SPEAKER_01, Wow.
1575.96,1579.96,SPEAKER_02," And then if I want, I can go back to work half time."
1579.96,1580.96,SPEAKER_01, Wow.
1580.96,1583.96,SPEAKER_02," So, but I might go back to work full time."
1583.96,1584.96,SPEAKER_02," I, Norman, I don't know what'll happen."
1584.96,1587.96,SPEAKER_02, It depends on what's going on with his work too.
1587.96,1589.96,SPEAKER_02, Right now he's only on a six month contract.
1589.96,1592.96,SPEAKER_01, So he could be Mr. Mom then and you feel back to that.
1592.96,1593.96,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1593.96,1594.96,SPEAKER_02, That's one of the things we're talking about.
1594.96,1597.96,SPEAKER_02, We don't want to put the baby in daycare until he's at least a year old.
1597.96,1598.96,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1598.96,1599.96,SPEAKER_01," That's because, yeah."
1599.96,1601.96,SPEAKER_02," So that's another thing to think about is, you know."
1601.96,1602.96,SPEAKER_02," Oh, I know that."
1602.96,1604.96,SPEAKER_01, That's exactly what I'm thinking about.
1604.96,1608.96,SPEAKER_01, My job situation is not going to get any more flexible than it is right now.
1608.96,1611.96,SPEAKER_01, It's going to only get less flexible or stay the same.
1611.96,1612.96,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1612.96,1613.96,SPEAKER_01, So I might as well go for it.
1613.96,1616.96,SPEAKER_01, And Anne has been trying for over a year.
1616.96,1618.96,SPEAKER_01," And so her stories don't put it off, you know."
1618.96,1620.96,SPEAKER_01, Just go for it if you want to have a baby.
1620.96,1621.96,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1621.96,1622.96,SPEAKER_02," Well, I agree with that."
1622.96,1623.96,SPEAKER_02," I mean, you're old enough."
1623.96,1624.96,SPEAKER_02, You're married.
1624.96,1626.96,SPEAKER_02," You know, you know, that that's what you want."
1626.96,1627.96,SPEAKER_02, So just go for it.
1627.96,1630.96,SPEAKER_02, And there are problems associated with waiting until you're older.
1630.96,1634.96,SPEAKER_02," I mean, the incidence of birth defects are down syndrome increases."
1634.96,1635.96,SPEAKER_02, I'm going to be visiting increases.
1635.96,1637.96,SPEAKER_01, I'm just worried about Jim's energy level.
1637.96,1639.96,SPEAKER_01, He needs to be able to help me.
1639.96,1641.96,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, he's old."
1641.96,1642.96,SPEAKER_01, That was true.
1642.96,1648.96,SPEAKER_02," So, you know, if you know that that's what you want, and there's no reason not to go ahead and do it."
1648.96,1650.96,SPEAKER_01, I'm going to go ahead and do that.
1650.96,1651.96,SPEAKER_02, And you can never be prepared.
1651.96,1652.96,SPEAKER_02, Take my word for it.
1652.96,1654.96,SPEAKER_02, I have totally mixed feelings all the time.
1654.96,1657.96,SPEAKER_02, Sometimes I'm so happy and just excited.
1657.96,1662.96,SPEAKER_02," Like today I was reading, there's a news group, miss.kids.pregnancy."
1662.96,1665.96,SPEAKER_02, And then someone posted like the birth story of their baby.
1665.96,1666.96,SPEAKER_02, You know?
1666.96,1668.96,SPEAKER_02," I mean, I read it and I was like crying at the end."
1668.96,1670.96,SPEAKER_02, It was just like the most beautiful thing.
1670.96,1674.96,SPEAKER_02," And another time I'm just like, oh my god, what did I do?"
1674.96,1676.96,SPEAKER_02, Our life is going to change so much.
1676.96,1677.96,SPEAKER_02, I don't want a baby.
1677.96,1679.96,SPEAKER_02, I'm not ready for it.
1679.96,1695.96,SPEAKER_02," So, you know, you just, whatever feelings you have, you know, it's just, it's not going to, like you're going to have mixed feelings if you get pregnant now, if you get pregnant in the year from now, if you get pregnant 10 years from now, sort of thing."
1695.96,1696.96,SPEAKER_01, I know.
1696.96,1697.96,SPEAKER_02, I know.
1697.96,1698.96,SPEAKER_01, I know.
1698.96,1699.96,SPEAKER_01, And it's going to only get worse.
1699.96,1700.96,SPEAKER_01, I'm ready now.
1700.96,1701.96,SPEAKER_01, We're ready.
1701.96,1702.96,SPEAKER_01, We're going to go for it.
1702.96,1703.96,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1703.96,1704.96,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1704.96,1707.96,SPEAKER_01," So, we've been practicing with the cat, you know."
1707.96,1712.96,SPEAKER_02," And they're just, there's no way that you can practice until it's your own."
1712.96,1713.96,SPEAKER_02, And it's so exciting.
1713.96,1715.96,SPEAKER_02," I mean, it's just really exciting."
1715.96,1720.96,SPEAKER_02," Like, nor am I going to have a baby that's like, to me, it's a combination of me enormous."
1720.96,1721.96,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1721.96,1723.96,SPEAKER_02, It's the most amazing thing in the world.
1723.96,1726.96,SPEAKER_02," Like, the baby's going to be also best, you know."
1726.96,1729.96,SPEAKER_02, It's totally bizarre to me that that's true.
1729.96,1730.96,SPEAKER_01, It's weird.
1730.96,1731.96,SPEAKER_01, I know.
1731.96,1733.96,SPEAKER_01, And mine's going to be so smart and so beautiful.
1733.96,1734.96,SPEAKER_02," So, it's weird."
1734.96,1738.96,SPEAKER_01, Everybody thinks they're babies with that in the whole wide world.
1738.96,1741.96,SPEAKER_02," But I'm like, you know, and it's, it's just going to be so weird."
1741.96,1746.96,SPEAKER_02," And of course, when I imagine that they've always imagined it look like norm, but lately it's been like in my mind."
1746.96,1749.96,SPEAKER_02, It's been looking a little bit more like me too.
1749.96,1751.96,SPEAKER_01," Well, you guys look kind of similar in some ways."
1751.96,1752.96,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, we do."
1752.96,1755.96,SPEAKER_02," I mean, we know it'll have dark hair and pale skin."
1755.96,1756.96,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1756.96,1758.96,SPEAKER_02, But in the hair.
1758.96,1764.96,SPEAKER_02," So, I thought what's going on with Anne, is she trying any treatments or, you know, they're just trying."
1764.96,1765.96,SPEAKER_01, I doubt it.
1765.96,1771.96,SPEAKER_01, I think she's trying to exercise and take care of herself and stuff and not have so much stress as she is still.
1771.96,1773.96,SPEAKER_02, But stress can be.
1773.96,1776.96,SPEAKER_01," She gets migraines, you know, and she's a stress cadet."
1776.96,1777.96,SPEAKER_02, Uh-huh.
1777.96,1781.96,SPEAKER_01," So, but it's, um, it's actually been pretty good at work."
1781.96,1783.96,SPEAKER_01," You know, I haven't been taking it too seriously."
1783.96,1787.96,SPEAKER_01, I've been into my relationship and my life and as a whole.
1787.96,1794.96,SPEAKER_01," And I do a lot of stuff for this, you know, group that my church has belonged through this EECM."
1794.96,1796.96,SPEAKER_03, Mm-hmm.
1796.96,1799.96,SPEAKER_01," And, um, tutoring and stuff."
1799.96,1802.96,SPEAKER_01," And, um, I think she's trying to do that."
