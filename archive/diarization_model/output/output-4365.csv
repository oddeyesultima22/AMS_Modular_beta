0.00,2.00,SPEAKER_01, I guess that's it.
2.00,5.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, well, I won't talk about the president."
5.00,7.00,SPEAKER_00," No, I talked to Doug."
7.00,12.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, I guess, well, the thing is, Doug was kind of annoying me a little bit."
12.00,20.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, the first of all, I think he sort of knew he didn't want him to be here, but still he wants someplace to bring people."
20.00,22.00,SPEAKER_00," It's like, how long are you going to be here?"
22.00,26.00,SPEAKER_00, So I really don't think that it's very appropriate or so forth.
26.00,27.00,SPEAKER_00, It's not your invocation.
27.00,29.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, what's the point?"
29.00,30.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
30.00,32.00,SPEAKER_00," And it's sort of, I'm kind of annoyed."
32.00,33.00,SPEAKER_02," It's kind of like, what's that?"
33.00,36.00,SPEAKER_02," You know why he wants to bring people there, right?"
36.00,37.00,SPEAKER_00, Why?
37.00,40.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, you know, his boyfriend's in the past."
40.00,45.00,SPEAKER_00," Yes, but I'm sorry, I don't want another Lee worthy, okay?"
45.00,46.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, what?"
46.00,49.00,SPEAKER_00," And I don't, I'm putting this, I don't think it's beyond that, okay?"
49.00,50.00,SPEAKER_01, Huh.
50.00,51.00,SPEAKER_00, I don't think it's beyond that.
51.00,54.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, I think Lee is actually a little bit cleaner than."
54.00,58.00,SPEAKER_00, It's what I'm sort of kind of figuring out now for a while.
58.00,61.00,SPEAKER_00," And I just don't like it, you know what I mean?"
61.00,62.00,SPEAKER_00, Uh huh.
62.00,63.00,SPEAKER_00," This is not a motel, okay?"
63.00,64.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, I don't know."
64.00,66.00,SPEAKER_00," Okay, and it kind of annoys me."
66.00,67.00,SPEAKER_00," It's like, oh, you're going to be showing up."
67.00,68.00,SPEAKER_00, I don't care.
68.00,70.00,SPEAKER_00, I'll show it whenever I please.
70.00,73.00,SPEAKER_00," Anyway, and then, anyway, we were supposed to do something with air."
73.00,76.00,SPEAKER_00," I mentioned, well, the one we get together with Eric or something Friday."
76.00,77.00,SPEAKER_01, Uh huh.
77.00,79.00,SPEAKER_00," You know, let's, you know, got to a movie and so forth."
79.00,81.00,SPEAKER_00," I wanted to see the species movie, which was pretty good."
81.00,82.00,SPEAKER_01," I like it, yeah."
82.00,84.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, but the thing is, is that he never calls."
84.00,85.00,SPEAKER_00, Never does anything.
85.00,86.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
86.00,88.00,SPEAKER_00, And so all I get now is I get some message.
88.00,91.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, I just, I want to get a hold of the key."
91.00,92.00,SPEAKER_00, When can I get it?
92.00,94.00,SPEAKER_00, It wants me to straighten up or something.
94.00,98.00,SPEAKER_00," It's like, I'm not going to straighten up so this can be a yacute little nest."
98.00,99.00,SPEAKER_00, I'm sorry.
99.00,101.00,SPEAKER_00," And it just, it just sort of annoys me."
101.00,102.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
102.00,105.00,SPEAKER_00," You know, if you want to do, do any of that other stuff, just go somewhere else."
105.00,106.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
106.00,107.00,SPEAKER_02, I don't know.
107.00,108.00,SPEAKER_02, Sweetest.
108.00,109.00,SPEAKER_00," No, I just think it's bullshit."
109.00,110.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, that's, I'm sorry."
110.00,113.00,SPEAKER_02," But it's, I just think you're getting a little work done."
113.00,114.00,SPEAKER_00," No, I'm sorry."
114.00,115.00,SPEAKER_00, I don't got time for this crap.
115.00,116.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
116.00,117.00,SPEAKER_00, That's about it.
117.00,118.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
118.00,122.00,SPEAKER_00," I, I, I have to feed some animals now and worry about that now and then this other."
122.00,123.00,SPEAKER_02, Rubbish.
123.00,124.00,SPEAKER_02, What's that?
124.00,125.00,SPEAKER_02, Are you staying over there?
125.00,127.00,SPEAKER_00, I'm thinking about it.
127.00,128.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
128.00,129.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
129.00,130.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, then why not?"
130.00,133.00,SPEAKER_00, I just wish you would mention to me before you offer.
133.00,134.00,SPEAKER_02, I did.
134.00,137.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, I was kind of saying I was kind of hesitant."
137.00,138.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
138.00,143.00,SPEAKER_00," I don't know if you asked me, you mentioned it and then I came to discussion after you'd mentioned it to Dabbo."
143.00,147.00,SPEAKER_00," But beforehand, I'd kind of been kind of like negative on it."
147.00,148.00,SPEAKER_02, I don't know.
148.00,152.00,SPEAKER_02," I just, I guess I never really thought that it would be that big a deal, you know."
152.00,153.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
153.00,159.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, I mean, I, I, I just think that it's largely because you're in a really high stress situation."
159.00,162.00,SPEAKER_00, I'm in a situation where I need full control of my environment.
162.00,163.00,SPEAKER_02, I know.
163.00,164.00,SPEAKER_00, I know.
164.00,165.00,SPEAKER_00, I know.
165.00,166.00,SPEAKER_00," So, I was just."
166.00,167.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, it doesn't call it."
167.00,170.00,SPEAKER_00," I just, I mean, Friday and all I do is get this message on a key."
170.00,172.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, talk about a little bit rude."
172.00,173.00,SPEAKER_00, I'm sorry.
173.00,175.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, it's really rude if you ask me."
175.00,178.00,SPEAKER_00," It's just like, I just want to use you for something here."
178.00,180.00,SPEAKER_01, I don't think it's like that.
180.00,188.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, I think the behavior indicates that at least at least, you know, Mr. Mr., Mr. Very sensitive and aware of other people's behaviors."
188.00,190.00,SPEAKER_00, Obviously not super aware of his own a little bit.
190.00,195.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, no, but you know that he acts abrupt like that anyway, right?"
195.00,198.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, I, I, I will, I'll have to rough this."
198.00,200.00,SPEAKER_00, It's sort of funny.
200.00,204.00,SPEAKER_00," But anyway, the movie was good yesterday though."
204.00,206.00,SPEAKER_00," I, I, I, I might call him back Monday."
206.00,208.00,SPEAKER_02," What am I supposed to do, you know?"
208.00,209.00,SPEAKER_00, You're not supposed to do anything.
209.00,210.00,SPEAKER_00, I'll take care of it.
210.00,215.00,SPEAKER_00," I am going to mention to him that I do think it was sort of rude that he didn't do that and all I get is this message, blah, you know."
215.00,222.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, you could, yeah, I mean, I think it's valid for you to yell at him for standing and you guys up and stuff."
222.00,227.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, it wasn't an official plan, but it's not as if he gave me a number to contact him at."
227.00,228.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
228.00,232.00,SPEAKER_00," So I just, I was a little bit, a little bit put off by it."
232.00,233.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
233.00,235.00,SPEAKER_00," You know, and, and I was saying."
235.00,240.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, he could probably say that he felt put off by you too, so."
240.00,241.00,SPEAKER_00, I don't think so.
241.00,243.00,SPEAKER_00, I was the one who suggested going out and doing something.
243.00,250.00,SPEAKER_00, So I think he can be said put off by me is that my life hangs in the balance and I would like to be left alone.
250.00,252.00,SPEAKER_00, I don't think that that's unreasonable.
252.00,253.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
253.00,254.00,SPEAKER_00," You know, I, you know, it's."
254.00,265.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, I know, I agree, but, you know, also if, you know, you're not going to be there during the week or two."
265.00,276.00,SPEAKER_00," The way I kind of feel is like if you want a soft place to lie your head down and fall asleep and wake up, cook food or whatever, and put around once in a while, that's fine."
276.00,282.00,SPEAKER_00," But if you want a place where, you know, it's, it's time for Saturday night few or party."
282.00,283.00,SPEAKER_00, I'm sorry.
283.00,284.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, come on."
284.00,285.00,SPEAKER_02, He's not quite like that.
285.00,288.00,SPEAKER_00," Yes, but still that's kind of my."
288.00,292.00,SPEAKER_02," No, he's got people that he hasn't seen for quite a while."
292.00,295.00,SPEAKER_00," Don't they, don't they live somewhere?"
295.00,297.00,SPEAKER_00, You know what I'm saying?
297.00,299.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, not all of them."
299.00,302.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, I get the impression not all of them."
302.00,305.00,SPEAKER_02, Can you go back to that place?
305.00,308.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, have you ever actually talked to him about it?"
308.00,309.00,SPEAKER_00," No, but anyway."
309.00,314.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, because some of them, you know, I understand."
314.00,316.00,SPEAKER_00, I think I understand what you're saying now.
316.00,318.00,SPEAKER_00, I think I figured it out that.
318.00,324.00,SPEAKER_02," So he would like to have a place where they can come, you know, visit him."
324.00,325.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
325.00,330.00,SPEAKER_02," And so, and so it's fine."
330.00,331.00,SPEAKER_00, Never mind.
331.00,333.00,SPEAKER_00," I thought I had a hilarious word for it, but anyway."
333.00,336.00,SPEAKER_00, I had a one and a second.
336.00,337.00,SPEAKER_00, It's not.
337.00,340.00,SPEAKER_00, It's a word plan on what you just said.
340.00,342.00,SPEAKER_00, It's kind of a switch to runny.
342.00,343.00,SPEAKER_00, But it comes in.
343.00,344.00,SPEAKER_00, It comes in.
344.00,346.00,SPEAKER_00," There's some truth to it, you know."
346.00,347.00,SPEAKER_02, What is it?
347.00,350.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, they can visit him and come."
350.00,351.00,SPEAKER_00, They will.
351.00,352.00,SPEAKER_02, Uh-huh.
352.00,353.00,SPEAKER_00, Uh-huh.
353.00,355.00,SPEAKER_00, Is it a coming and visiting?
355.00,356.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
356.00,358.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, okay."
358.00,362.00,SPEAKER_02," But I mean, anyway, anyway."
362.00,377.00,SPEAKER_02," So my thought on the whole thing is that, you know, if you visit him, you wouldn't want to have to be, you know, spent panting and spending every second of the day with him only, you know what I'm saying?"
377.00,386.00,SPEAKER_02, And that probably part of the reason that it would be nice to actually stay with him is that you could also go and visit the site or whatever.
386.00,387.00,SPEAKER_02, Where?
387.00,388.00,SPEAKER_02, Can you talk about?
388.00,389.00,SPEAKER_00, In Japan.
389.00,390.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm not going to Japan.
391.00,392.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm trying to.
392.00,394.00,SPEAKER_00," Maybe in ten years, but no time soon."
394.00,396.00,SPEAKER_02," No, no, but no, you know what I'm saying."
396.00,405.00,SPEAKER_02, When you are visiting a town and you stay at someone's house and you can't ever do anything on your own and stuff like that.
405.00,407.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, I don't want any stuff on my own."
407.00,412.00,SPEAKER_00," I just, you know, I mean, there's a difference between guests and there's a difference between ownership, I think."
412.00,418.00,SPEAKER_00," I think that there, I mean, if I live somewhere, you know, I can rearrange the furniture."
418.00,421.00,SPEAKER_00," But if I'm staying somewhere, it doesn't mean I'm in jail."
421.00,427.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, just because I'm in a motel doesn't mean I'm going to repaint the walls, but it doesn't mean that I'm obligated to stay there either."
427.00,428.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, I open it."
428.00,434.00,SPEAKER_00," I'm just saying there are different degrees of, you know, I don't think he's obligated to sit there and hobnob around with me the entire time either."
434.00,435.00,SPEAKER_00, I wouldn't want him to.
435.00,436.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
436.00,437.00,SPEAKER_00," I told him I said, I have no time to do anything."
437.00,438.00,SPEAKER_00," And I said, I said, I..."
438.00,440.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, maybe that's why he was trying."
440.00,443.00,SPEAKER_00," And as soon as I move back here, he's out."
443.00,447.00,SPEAKER_00, I totally insist that I don't care if he never talks to me again.
447.00,457.00,SPEAKER_00," Because there's no way I can study with worry about keeping somebody awake or, you know, I have to worry about how I'm dressed if I'm clean, you know, whatever."
457.00,458.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
458.00,462.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, I agree with that sweetie, but in that case, I think that, well..."
462.00,464.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, he can stay while I'm at Ariesha Beth's."
464.00,465.00,SPEAKER_00, That's fine.
465.00,466.00,SPEAKER_02, That was my point.
466.00,467.00,SPEAKER_02, That was my whole point.
467.00,471.00,SPEAKER_02, That's what is the big deal with just giving him a key and telling the duty one.
471.00,473.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, I have to go make a coffee too."
473.00,475.00,SPEAKER_02, Do you want me?
475.00,476.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, huh."
476.00,479.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, you know what I'm saying, and I'm kind of thinking about saying, well, here's, give me a couple of bucks."
479.00,480.00,SPEAKER_00, I'm going to get a copy.
480.00,482.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, or just give him..."
482.00,492.00,SPEAKER_02," Just give him your set of keys one day when you're studying and say here, and bring it back, you know, go make a copy and then bring it back."
492.00,498.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, I don't think that unreasonable for him to ask for a key when, you know, at least I, anyway."
498.00,499.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
499.00,504.00,SPEAKER_02," Okay, maybe not you have offered a long time ago that, oh, yes, you can stay here and bloody bloody block."
504.00,505.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
505.00,507.00,SPEAKER_02, And he knows that you're not going to be there.
507.00,510.00,SPEAKER_02," So I think that, you know, I don't think that it's unwritten."
510.00,511.00,SPEAKER_02," Okay, yeah."
511.00,515.00,SPEAKER_00, I just think he needs to know that there are limits or whatever that I don't want it.
515.00,522.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, I'd like to be able to come here during the day, anytime, and not feel like if I need a book or something."
522.00,523.00,SPEAKER_01, Uh huh.
523.00,527.00,SPEAKER_00," I don't want to feel restrained because it'll frustrate me, and I won't be able to come with it."
527.00,537.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, I think that that would be reasonable just to make an agreement with him at what time, you know, after what time of day will you cough before you come over?"
537.00,538.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
538.00,550.00,SPEAKER_02," Or, you know, so like between 8 p.m. and, you know, 10 a.m. if I have to come over, then I'll call first like that."
550.00,554.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, I don't think that's unreasonable, you know, or something like that."
554.00,555.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
555.00,561.00,SPEAKER_02, Because then he can feel comfortable and you can feel comfortable because you know it's going on.
561.00,562.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
562.00,563.00,SPEAKER_02, You know.
563.00,572.00,SPEAKER_02," And plus, you know, you're going to be at Suzanne's for what till the 11th or something?"
572.00,575.00,SPEAKER_00," No, until, well, that's right."
575.00,578.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, when you come back, I guess I'll be, I'll still be there."
578.00,579.00,SPEAKER_02," It'll be there, right."
579.00,580.00,SPEAKER_00," It'll be there, right."
580.00,586.00,SPEAKER_02," So, and then, so, just, but you'll be over here packing at that time partially."
586.00,589.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, partially, sure, of course."
589.00,592.00,SPEAKER_00, I deposited your other loan track that came in.
592.00,593.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, good."
593.00,594.00,SPEAKER_00, How much is it?
594.00,595.00,SPEAKER_00, It was 19 something.
595.00,596.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
596.00,597.00,SPEAKER_00, Thank you.
597.00,599.00,SPEAKER_00," The thing is, I took out 250 out of the account."
599.00,601.00,SPEAKER_00, I'm going to pay the electric bill.
601.00,605.00,SPEAKER_00," I'm going to pay, MBA, I'm going to pay some other people."
605.00,606.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
606.00,607.00,SPEAKER_02, That's not good.
607.00,609.00,SPEAKER_00," And then it was like 35, 50, 35."
609.00,610.00,SPEAKER_00, It was like different.
610.00,611.00,SPEAKER_02, I wrote two more checks.
611.00,612.00,SPEAKER_02, You don't need to give them two.
612.00,613.00,SPEAKER_02," No, it doesn't matter."
613.00,615.00,SPEAKER_00, We'll figure it out when we get back.
615.00,617.00,SPEAKER_00, I haven't done any cataloging at all.
617.00,619.00,SPEAKER_00, I've had sort of rough figures in my head.
619.00,622.00,SPEAKER_00," I know where everything is, so I can do it very quickly."
622.00,630.00,SPEAKER_00," But I just, I just haven't, because there's just, I get so much mail that I, I mean, I got a big pile that you're going to have to look through what you want to keep and throw away."
630.00,631.00,SPEAKER_00, I know.
631.00,635.00,SPEAKER_00," And so, I've thrown away some of the junk mail, but I haven't worried about most of it."
635.00,636.00,SPEAKER_00, It takes a lot of effort.
636.00,637.00,SPEAKER_00, Most of it's free anyway.
637.00,638.00,SPEAKER_02, I agree.
638.00,646.00,SPEAKER_02," So, I was thinking of sending mom and dad about 100 bucks."
646.00,648.00,SPEAKER_02, Does that sound reasonable to you?
648.00,649.00,SPEAKER_02, For what?
649.00,651.00,SPEAKER_02, Off of what I owe them.
651.00,654.00,SPEAKER_00, Is this a recent amount or your original loan amount?
654.00,656.00,SPEAKER_02, My original loan amount.
656.00,659.00,SPEAKER_02," I owe them, you know, $12,000 or something."
659.00,660.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
660.00,661.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
661.00,662.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
662.00,664.00,SPEAKER_00," What have, you get my other postcard yet?"
664.00,665.00,SPEAKER_00, I haven't mentioned Dateche.
665.00,666.00,SPEAKER_02," No, I didn't."
666.00,667.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, I thought Dateche."
667.00,669.00,SPEAKER_00, Are you going to work for this whole dollar?
669.00,670.00,SPEAKER_00, Possibly.
670.00,675.00,SPEAKER_00," Because actually, I was, I was thinking that in any case, I think in some sense, it'll be a lot of things."
675.00,677.00,SPEAKER_00," In some sense, it'll be a learning experience."
677.00,684.00,SPEAKER_02," I know, but when I talked to him in March, he didn't sound very optimistic about it."
684.00,685.00,SPEAKER_00, As far as one.
685.00,689.00,SPEAKER_02," That there would be anything, any possibility."
689.00,690.00,SPEAKER_00, Because.
690.00,699.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, partially because he wanted some to train someone to do it long term, and partially because he thought he might have enough people already and stuff like that."
699.00,700.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
700.00,701.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, that's so fun."
701.00,706.00,SPEAKER_02," So, you know, I said, okay, well, you know, we can talk about it later and stuff like that."
706.00,708.00,SPEAKER_02, But he did not sound.
708.00,711.00,SPEAKER_00, It just sounds like a kind of cool thing you could put on that.
711.00,718.00,SPEAKER_02," I know, I know it sounds like a nice thing to do, but I'm not sure that I'll be able to, you know what I'm saying."
718.00,719.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
719.00,721.00,SPEAKER_02, But I'll definitely talk to him again.
721.00,726.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, because it would be cool if it was only like five hours a week because it would be just enough so you could get learned something."
726.00,728.00,SPEAKER_02," Or not going to be crazy, anyway."
728.00,729.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, I know."
729.00,733.00,SPEAKER_02," So, I'm going to be teaching two classes and taking 13 credit hours."
733.00,736.00,SPEAKER_00, Why didn't you take 12 or 10 or something?
736.00,745.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, because one of the courses has a co-requisite so it's four credit hours and the other ones I need and there you have it."
745.00,746.00,SPEAKER_00, Well.
746.00,752.00,SPEAKER_02," So, you know, it's possible, but we'll just have to see."
752.00,753.00,SPEAKER_02, That's my good.
753.00,754.00,SPEAKER_02," But, guess what?"
754.00,755.00,SPEAKER_02, Maybe the spring.
755.00,759.00,SPEAKER_02," I got your package, but I can't get it yet."
759.00,760.00,SPEAKER_00, Why?
760.00,762.00,SPEAKER_02, Because the mailroom window is closed.
762.00,763.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, I know."
763.00,764.00,SPEAKER_02, Get your surprise.
764.00,768.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, I got to take a nap today."
768.00,774.00,SPEAKER_00," I almost came back from Nikita's party and head, head, pizza and stuff and I was sort of tired."
774.00,776.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, I was up late last night with Eric talking to Eric."
776.00,777.00,SPEAKER_00, He was fun to talk to.
777.00,780.00,SPEAKER_02," I know, when I called to, he was still chatting."
780.00,783.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, so I chatted for like three hours."
783.00,784.00,SPEAKER_02, Wow.
784.00,785.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, another thing."
785.00,788.00,SPEAKER_02, I was talking to mom and dad.
788.00,789.00,SPEAKER_02, Uh-huh.
789.00,795.00,SPEAKER_02," And I don't think I've told you what they recommended about investment yet, have I?"
795.00,796.00,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
796.00,799.00,SPEAKER_00," But, I mean, the thing is I'm going to worry about investment when we're out of debt."
799.00,801.00,SPEAKER_02," No, I know that."
801.00,817.00,SPEAKER_02," But, but mother, mom's recommendation was that we should put that we should invest, no, even though it's money because that gets us started and you always put it off later, no matter what."
817.00,818.00,SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.
818.00,822.00,SPEAKER_02, And dad's recommendation was pay off the credit cards.
822.00,835.00,SPEAKER_02," But then when they talked to me together on the phone, they kind of came to this agreement that it would be, the optimal situation would be to invest $250 with the payment."
835.00,837.00,SPEAKER_02, And then pay off credit cards.
837.00,845.00,SPEAKER_02," And once you've invested $250 in this one fund, then you can send in small amounts whenever you want."
845.00,848.00,SPEAKER_02, But you have to make a $250 initial investment.
848.00,853.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, for it to make worthwhile for them to essentially have it run into."
853.00,854.00,SPEAKER_01, So through this hassle.
854.00,855.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
855.00,857.00,SPEAKER_00," Uh, I think that's a good idea."
857.00,861.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, I'm really, I think I really look forward to trying to work a lot this spring."
861.00,864.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, if you take one class and I work."
864.00,870.00,SPEAKER_00," Because if we don't get, if we don't get close to out of debt, I will not, I refuse to go to Europe."
870.00,872.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, I'm going to stick to that."
872.00,874.00,SPEAKER_02," I know, I'm trying."
874.00,878.00,SPEAKER_02," I'm just saying, you know, it doesn't it help that I have a fellowship."
878.00,881.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, I think it's, yeah, I think it's wonderful."
881.00,883.00,SPEAKER_00, That's why I'm thinking that there is an opportunity.
883.00,884.00,SPEAKER_00, I think that we freeze it.
884.00,887.00,SPEAKER_00," If we really do everything correctly, it can be done."
887.00,889.00,SPEAKER_00, I'm not going to buy any stereo equipment.
889.00,891.00,SPEAKER_00, I don't want to buy any stereo equipment.
891.00,898.00,SPEAKER_00," I, and simply going to buy things which that we absolutely need or really help us in some special way right now."
898.00,899.00,SPEAKER_00, Uh huh.
899.00,900.00,SPEAKER_00, So forth.
900.00,902.00,SPEAKER_00," I'm always going to, I was ready to elmer of all things."
902.00,903.00,SPEAKER_00," Talk, talk about it."
903.00,906.00,SPEAKER_00," I was going to, I was thinking of, I don't know why I thought about this."
906.00,907.00,SPEAKER_01, How did he do it?
907.00,913.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, he was hanging around with this guy, John, who's in library sciences, and they were going out to the country to look at stars at the telescope."
913.00,915.00,SPEAKER_01, I have something fun.
915.00,916.00,SPEAKER_00, So that's not pretty cool.
916.00,917.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
917.00,918.00,SPEAKER_00," What he's doing, fine."
918.00,920.00,SPEAKER_00, He popped by not too long ago and so forth.
920.00,921.00,SPEAKER_00, He's doing okay.
921.00,922.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, he does this."
922.00,923.00,SPEAKER_00, How about computer for?
923.00,924.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
924.00,927.00,SPEAKER_00," It's nice and all, but I mean, I think, you know, I like it to an extent."
927.00,930.00,SPEAKER_00," I would like to know more, but I would never want to be into it like he is."
930.00,931.00,SPEAKER_00, It's just not me.
931.00,932.00,SPEAKER_00, I'd rather read some weird book.
932.00,933.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
933.00,934.00,SPEAKER_01," They're too, they're too."
934.00,936.00,SPEAKER_00, It just kind of sexual life away.
936.00,938.00,SPEAKER_00, Species was okay.
938.00,940.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, it's so good."
940.00,944.00,SPEAKER_02," Um, oh, um, the other thing I was going to ask you about."
944.00,955.00,SPEAKER_02," I would mom called earlier today and I was talking to her and she was saying that there is a, that she was talking about Grammy and Grandin."
955.00,959.00,SPEAKER_02, She went over to cut their lawn and stuff like that.
959.00,994.00,SPEAKER_02," And so what I said is that I was hoping that you and I could get down there maybe the first weekend after classes or, um, you know, those next couple weekends to help them out with projects around the house that they've got, you know, and mom, when I mentioned this, mom, um, you know, I said, well, think about something that you guys need help with, you know, so that we would come down for a weekend and just really clean that house."
994.00,995.00,SPEAKER_02, Exactly.
995.00,996.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
996.00,997.00,SPEAKER_02, And I mentioned two things.
997.00,1002.00,SPEAKER_02, One of them was painting the fence out back and the patio cover.
1002.00,1010.00,SPEAKER_02," And then the other one was, um, going through all my crud, you know, that I've got left there"
1010.00,1015.00,SPEAKER_00," still in the, oh, the one thing that I've told them that we have to do is stack everything."
1015.00,1023.00,SPEAKER_02," Right, but everything. I have to go through it all and sell the, the, the, the extraneous junk, you know, the mine."
1023.00,1026.00,SPEAKER_00," Throw away your boyfriend, mementos."
1026.00,1029.00,SPEAKER_00," Be the, in large slew of them."
1029.00,1031.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, sure."
1031.00,1032.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
1032.00,1033.00,SPEAKER_00," Um, anyway, so."
1033.00,1036.00,SPEAKER_02," But, you know, because I've got so much stuff left over there."
1036.00,1038.00,SPEAKER_02, I don't know what you think about that though.
1038.00,1039.00,SPEAKER_00, I think it's fine.
1039.00,1049.00,SPEAKER_00," I think one, the first thing we should try to box things up, get rid of what we don't want and get it all efficiently sort of way in that room for, um, your parents are they least they can use it for something."
1049.00,1050.00,SPEAKER_01, Right.
1050.00,1051.00,SPEAKER_00, So.
1051.00,1054.00,SPEAKER_00," I talked to Natasha the other day, I was talking to Tasha yesterday."
1054.00,1056.00,SPEAKER_00," We had a, well actually I went to Nikita's birthday party."
1056.00,1059.00,SPEAKER_00," That's why I talked to her, but, uh, the party was a lot of fun."
1059.00,1061.00,SPEAKER_00," We were, we were being really crazy."
1061.00,1064.00,SPEAKER_00," These kids were, I think we were kind of weirding him out."
1064.00,1068.00,SPEAKER_00," All of us were just, we were being, we were laughing really hard."
1068.00,1071.00,SPEAKER_00," We were being, there was just a lot of puns we were making."
1071.00,1076.00,SPEAKER_00," We're just kind of sort of like if the kids could have understood them, they, they would have been bad."
1076.00,1078.00,SPEAKER_00, So it was pretty funny.
1078.00,1083.00,SPEAKER_00," I talked to Natasha and, and evidently she's, she was like, this wild woman."
1083.00,1090.00,SPEAKER_00," I was kind of, who was talking about it, you can guess what, but I was just kind of, kind of put it back by the whole thing."
1090.00,1092.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, and that's kind of talking to her."
1092.00,1095.00,SPEAKER_00," And she's like, and she's just, well I'm always one who initiates it."
1095.00,1097.00,SPEAKER_00, Because I'm scared of the kids.
1097.00,1099.00,SPEAKER_02, So she's showing us a lot of people.
1099.00,1102.00,SPEAKER_02," No, what she has period period, I don't know."
1102.00,1105.00,SPEAKER_00," And she just, you know, she just, well we just hear something."
1105.00,1106.00,SPEAKER_00, That was fun.
1106.00,1108.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh well, in fact she doesn't love anybody."
1108.00,1114.00,SPEAKER_00," She just, I think she, I actually sort of wonder if she has the ability to, you know, she's very cold."
1114.00,1115.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1115.00,1117.00,SPEAKER_00," She, yeah."
1117.00,1120.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, you know, it could have something to do with her blood sugar, you know."
1120.00,1122.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, well of course."
1122.00,1123.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1123.00,1125.00,SPEAKER_02, So it's a lot of flexibility in the mouth.
1125.00,1128.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, we should get a couple postcards from me, probably Monday or Tuesday."
1128.00,1129.00,SPEAKER_00, We'll get some postcards.
1129.00,1134.00,SPEAKER_00," And, and then we'll, you know, then you'll come back and I'll pick you up."
1134.00,1137.00,SPEAKER_00, You just send me email about what time Louis will and everything.
1137.00,1138.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1138.00,1142.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, did you get my email that Bush was changing the flight?"
1142.00,1143.00,SPEAKER_00, No.
1143.00,1145.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, you need to check your email."
1145.00,1146.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, I'm sorry."
1146.00,1147.00,SPEAKER_00, I don't have time.
1147.00,1148.00,SPEAKER_02," No, it's okay."
1148.00,1151.00,SPEAKER_00," But anyway, so what, when is the flight going to be then?"
1151.00,1153.00,SPEAKER_02, Earlier on Sunday.
1153.00,1154.00,SPEAKER_00, Earlier than 12.
1154.00,1155.00,SPEAKER_02, I don't know.
1155.00,1158.00,SPEAKER_00, Could you talk something about the flight recently?
1158.00,1159.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, that was what it was."
1159.00,1161.00,SPEAKER_00," Okay, so sometime around noon, okay."
1161.00,1162.00,SPEAKER_02, I don't know.
1162.00,1166.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, we'll be flying out of Albuquerque around seven or something."
1166.00,1168.00,SPEAKER_00," Okay, so you're being low-fold around noon, okay?"
1168.00,1171.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, it's about a three and a half hour or so."
1171.00,1173.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, we're going to probably still have all these."
1173.00,1174.00,SPEAKER_00, Interchange.
1174.00,1175.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, exactly."
1175.00,1180.00,SPEAKER_02," So, but anyway, it'll be, probably that'll be better anyway, right?"
1180.00,1183.00,SPEAKER_02, Cause we won't be driving in the middle of the night.
1183.00,1184.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, sure."
1184.00,1185.00,SPEAKER_02, I got my new glasses.
1185.00,1186.00,SPEAKER_02," Hey, how do they fit?"
1186.00,1190.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, first of all, the, well, I sent you a letter kind of describing my postcards."
1190.00,1194.00,SPEAKER_00, My postcard about how the IU of Tom Tree people screwed them up.
1194.00,1195.00,SPEAKER_01, They did.
1195.00,1196.00,SPEAKER_01, What happened?
1196.00,1207.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, the thing was when I first got them to frames, essentially, you know where the stems that bend, they were, they were probably for somebody with a slightly narrower head than mine."
1207.00,1208.00,SPEAKER_00, So they kind of pushed down a little bit.
1208.00,1216.00,SPEAKER_00," So I had this idea that I was going to take a piece of sandpaper, remove a little bit of this metal and so they would open up a little bit more, but not deforming the shape."
1216.00,1220.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, when I get them back, it looks like somebody had some fun with them or something."
1220.00,1225.00,SPEAKER_00," Either they put lenses in there, a little bit, not cut quite right."
1225.00,1228.00,SPEAKER_00," So they actually would spread, they spread them out a little bit."
1228.00,1230.00,SPEAKER_00, So these things were sort of spread.
1230.00,1232.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, they were, like, they were loose."
1232.00,1234.00,SPEAKER_00, They were unwieldy on my face.
1234.00,1236.00,SPEAKER_02, That's really weird.
1236.00,1237.00,SPEAKER_00, And so I was sort of annoyed.
1237.00,1238.00,SPEAKER_00, Did you go back?
1238.00,1242.00,SPEAKER_02, Did you go back and tell them to fix it?
1242.00,1243.00,SPEAKER_02," No, what?"
1243.00,1251.00,SPEAKER_00," Do you think I want this, you know, this girl, the 22 year old girl to fix them?"
1251.00,1252.00,SPEAKER_00, No way.
1252.00,1256.00,SPEAKER_00," I saw them and I was kind of looking at them and she's like, oh no, don't bend."
1256.00,1258.00,SPEAKER_00, She's afraid I'm just going to break them.
1258.00,1261.00,SPEAKER_00, But she was just doing weird stuff and she had no idea what she was doing.
1261.00,1268.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, talk to someone who's really in charge and say, look, you guys have messed up my glasses and what are you going to do?"
1268.00,1273.00,SPEAKER_00, It's very subtle and I had some certain hypotheses about what had actually happened to them.
1273.00,1274.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
1274.00,1278.00,SPEAKER_00," But when they weren't totally messed up, they looked, they were bent out a little bit."
1278.00,1280.00,SPEAKER_00, And they were sitting too loose in my face.
1280.00,1281.00,SPEAKER_00," Anyway, why fix them?"
1281.00,1283.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, so it's okay now?"
1283.00,1284.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1284.00,1290.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, actually I heated them up with the steamer, which I actually slightly, ever since I was, I don't really care at all."
1290.00,1294.00,SPEAKER_00," I thought they ever just, just colored the plastic on little spots here and there."
1294.00,1298.00,SPEAKER_00, And to heat them up because I guess the steam is not as good as a hairdryer for some reason.
1298.00,1300.00,SPEAKER_00, You get hot too hot or whatever.
1300.00,1304.00,SPEAKER_00," But anyway, so I fixed them myself and now they fit just perfectly fine."
1304.00,1305.00,SPEAKER_02, And they look okay.
1305.00,1308.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh yeah, but the thing that's so sad is that nobody has noticed."
1308.00,1309.00,SPEAKER_00, I have to tell everyone.
1309.00,1310.00,SPEAKER_01, That was the only one.
1310.00,1313.00,SPEAKER_00, I mentioned it and she could tell the difference.
1313.00,1317.00,SPEAKER_00," She said, well, those are a little bit this way and different in this way and this way."
1317.00,1318.00,SPEAKER_01, That's right.
1318.00,1320.00,SPEAKER_00," Okay, so you notice the difference."
1320.00,1327.00,SPEAKER_00," Okay, like everybody else, my brother, my sister, John, Paul, Eric, nobody noticed."

1341.00,1343.00,SPEAKER_00, Although I do think they look better in certain ways.
1343.00,1351.00,SPEAKER_00," Because I've noticed, actually the weird thing is I've kind of noticed that people kind of of see me a little bit differently now, but hopefully I think it a friendly over the way."
1351.00,1353.00,SPEAKER_00, Because they look a little bit better on my face.
1353.00,1354.00,SPEAKER_02," I like, anyway."
