0.00,7.36,SPEAKER_02, This is Claire and this is Candace and today they're going to handle the same issue from the same customer Tabitha Ratchet.
8.40,21.20,SPEAKER_02, The point of this video is to show you the difference between bad and great customer service and what I want you to do is to notice the difference between the two and then comment down below your observations. All right let's begin.
23.76,26.72,SPEAKER_02, Thank you for calling Questhaan. This is Claire. How may I help you today?
27.12,34.08,SPEAKER_01, I still have not received my order. You should have received it on the 20th. It's not the 22nd.
34.08,43.36,SPEAKER_01, Still nothing. I don't know what's going on but if it's not too much of a bother to you I would really really know love to get what I paid for. You know what I mean? Okay.
43.36,51.12,SPEAKER_01, You may have the order number and your first name. 498. 497. Tabitha Ratchet.
52.08,58.56,SPEAKER_02, Thank you. Let me just check that here. I mean it's ridiculous. If there's a delay you just
58.56,66.80,SPEAKER_01, tell me it's not like you don't have my email or anything. You didn't notify me at all. If I forgot that I'd ordered it which by the way happens sometimes then I could
66.80,79.20,SPEAKER_02, completely be paying for nothing. One moment please will I check your order status? Unbelievable. Are you even listening to me? I am. That's why I'm going to check this status for you okay?
79.76,86.24,SPEAKER_02, Okay fine go ahead. Thank you.
90.64,97.36,SPEAKER_02, Okay according to the FedEx node here your person was delivered on a 20-year at 10 a.m. and it was
97.36,136.48,SPEAKER_01, left on the front porch according to the nodes. What? You're kidding right? Okay okay first of all my apartment has no front porch. Second the only way to deliver parcels in a residence if they leave them to the concierge. That's it. Third I was at home the whole day on the 20th and no one literally no one knocked on my door or called my number to notify me of a parcel. So whatever this FedEx guy saying he's lying okay he's lying. Have you tried tracking with the buildings concierge to
136.48,153.84,SPEAKER_02, see if they have kept a package for you or I just checked this morning and the answer is no. There's no parcel. Otherwise I wouldn't have been calling you. How about your neighbors? Have you checked with them to see if they received your parcel? Just just what light and questioning is this?
153.84,163.60,SPEAKER_02, Are you saying that my neighbors stole my parcel? No no no I'm not saying that what I'm saying is they might have received your parcel while you were away. You're not listening to what I told you
163.60,182.72,SPEAKER_01," it was in the apartment the entire fucking day. If someone delivered a parcel the concierge would have received it by now. Second and I repeat the only way we received parcels here is through to concierge nothing else. No front porch, no neighbors, where even asking about my neighbors they have nothing to do with this and shooting you be questioning the fact that the FedEx said I have a"
182.72,194.24,SPEAKER_02, front porch when I clearly don't. Tevisa I'm just doing my job. This is a standard protocol we have to make sure that the receiver has checked all the possible places the parcel could have been
194.24,208.56,SPEAKER_01, delivered. I know. But do your job right? You're not even trying. I've been spending my time here listening to you and the only thing you're doing so far is asking me dumb questions. Like what kind of service is this? I just want to get what I paid for. Is that sort of wrong to ask?
209.76,216.40,SPEAKER_02, Please calm down Tevisa I'm here to help you. It helped me and for God's sake do it well.
216.40,223.20,SPEAKER_02, Jesus Christ. Okay Tevisa I'm sorry that this happened to you. Oh yes I bet you are.
224.24,235.76,SPEAKER_02, Okay for us to resolve this I will send you an email. Please reply to that email to confirm and writing that you did not receive the parcel. After that I'm getting it. I'm already talking
235.76,240.48,SPEAKER_01, you. What do you need me to email you for? I'm telling you right now I did not receive my parcel.
240.48,250.40,SPEAKER_02, So do something about it now. It's not that simple Tevisa you have to confirm writing because that's what we're going to show FedEx so they can begin the investigation.
251.28,271.36,SPEAKER_02, So you know this is necessary to prove that we are not making this all up. Once the claim is filed we will investigate and depending on the investigation it will take seven or seven business days and then we can refund or replace or find your missing parcel. So just by the dispute and get
271.36,280.80,SPEAKER_01, my money back. You know that I'm being nice right now right? I am contacting you first when I could just have followed my bank and mark you as fraud in an instant. You know that right?
282.16,292.88,SPEAKER_02, I wouldn't recommend that as that might poorly reflect on your credit score especially that it shows delivered you know. So the best option I recommend is to let us file a claim on your behalf. That's
292.88,319.92,SPEAKER_01, what I recommend. You know what? With the ridiculousness of the situation I can't even bring myself to be mad anymore. Like what is the point anyway? You basically have the emotional intelligence of a peanut so I envy you. That's for sure. Okay so how would you like to proceed? Well it's not like I have a choice. Take care of it. See with FedEx I didn't pay you to make me file the claim myself.
320.72,333.92,SPEAKER_02, So okay so after you confirm through email that you did not receive your parcel I will file a PDNR for you. What's PDNR? It means parcel delivered not received and I will take
333.92,343.68,SPEAKER_01, take it will take five to seven business days. Okay what happens if the parcel isn't found is a replacement available in your warehouse. I need a replacement for that I don't want to refund.
346.24,355.60,SPEAKER_02, Well since this is a dropship item we don't have the item in stock in our warehouse so I would first have to check with the dropship team for its availability. But yes I will take note of that.
355.60,362.48,SPEAKER_02, What's a dropship? It means that the item is in another warehouse and we don't have the inventory
362.48,386.08,SPEAKER_01," for it so we will first coordinate with a supplier. You know what you are making my head's pin. So let me get this straight. Seven business days for the investigation and if not found she's probably the case. Ninety-nine percent of the time you can check with a team if it's available and then what? Another seven days to deliver the replacement? Yes, correct."
388.64,389.20,SPEAKER_00, Mm-hmm.
392.00,403.28,SPEAKER_01, Well it tried to be nice to you guys but it seems like you left me no other choice. I will file a dispute and I will never shop from your site again. So as much as I would like to help you this is
403.28,423.52,SPEAKER_02, the best I can do for you. I have to follow the company policy as I said we can issue a replacement but we first have to file a claim and that will take five to seven business days. If that is too long for you to wait which which I understand. I suggest that you place another order with a different shipping address while the investigation is ongoing and we will just refund you
423.52,446.88,SPEAKER_01," for the first parcel but we first have to wait for the claim. Blah blah blah just stop okay just stop. I don't care anymore. I hope your company goes bankrupt and then no company will ever hire you again. Your attitude has been pretty disgusting, condescending the moment you picked up a phone and I cannot cannot for the life of me imagine and player who would want to hire you for that attitude."
446.88,451.76,SPEAKER_01, Continue living your miserable life. I'm just gonna go ahead and file that dispute. Bye bye.
458.00,462.80,SPEAKER_02, Thank you for calling question. This is Candace. How may I help you? I still have not received my order.
463.76,475.44,SPEAKER_01, You should have received it on the 20th. It's how the 22nd is still nothing. I don't know what's going on but if it's not too much of a bother to you I would really really not love to get what I paid for.
475.44,481.12,SPEAKER_02, You know what I mean? Oh if it's beyond the promise delivery date we definitely need to look into that.
481.12,485.36,SPEAKER_02, May have your order number and your full name so I can check for you. That's exactly what I'm thinking
485.36,499.36,SPEAKER_01," like. I don't understand. What was taking so long? Anyway the order number is 498, 497 and my name is Tabitha Ratchet. Thank you Tabitha. I will now go ahead and pull up your order"
499.36,526.72,SPEAKER_02, and hopefully I can give you an immediate answer. One moment please go ahead. Thank you. Okay like what she said the estimated delivery date is on the 20th. It's not 22nd so it's two days late. Normally when a parcel is late like this we send an email and forming you the delay so let me visit the FedEx website and track it. Thank you Candace. That would be
526.72,541.76,SPEAKER_01, appreciated. I actually haven't tried tracking it on the FedEx website since you already gave me the delivery date through email so yes please go ahead. Okay according to the FedEx note here
541.76,547.12,SPEAKER_02, your parcel was delivered on the 20th at 10am. It said that it was left on the front porch.
547.12,580.32,SPEAKER_01, Have you tried checking your front porch? What? What? What? What? You're kidding right? Okay. Okay first of all my apartment has no front porch. Second the only way to deliver parcels and a residence is by leaving them to the concierge. Third I was at home the whole day on the 20th and no one literally no one knocked on my door or called my number to notify me of a parcel. So whatever this FedEx guy is saying his line. Okay his line. That's that's definitely odd. Have you tried
580.32,584.72,SPEAKER_02, checking with your buildings concierge to see if they have kept a package for you? I just checked
584.72,590.88,SPEAKER_01, this morning and the answer is no otherwise I wouldn't be calling you. Yeah your neighbors also
590.88,596.72,SPEAKER_02, wouldn't happen to receive it right since as you said all parcels go to the concierge. Correct
596.72,610.72,SPEAKER_01, and if the note says he left it on my doorstep again that's impossible no one can access our doorsteps here except as 10am. So there's clearly a mistake here. Yes that makes sense. So here's
610.72,643.12,SPEAKER_02," what we're going to do Tabitha. It is likely that FedEx delivered the order to the wrong address so I will file a PDNR claim on your behalf. It means parcel delivered not received. What this does is to let FedEx investigate to find your missing parcel and after the investigation we will either refund, replace or find your missing parcel. Okay yeah and for me to initiate the claim I will send you an email right now. Please reply to that email confirming that you have not received your parcel."
645.04,650.32,SPEAKER_02, Your response to that email is very important because that will serve as the documentation.
650.40,685.04,SPEAKER_02, Moving to FedEx that you are requesting for us to file a claim on your behalf. Okay whatever happens I'm going to get my refund though right? You're right of course and the sooner they find your parcel the better. By the way in the event that the parcel isn't recovered would you prefer a replacement or a refund? I need a replacement for that I don't want to refund. Okay I will make note of that and after the investigation which usually takes five to seven business days I will check with a supplier for the availability of availability and then they can process the replacement for you.
686.88,697.92,SPEAKER_01, Okay it's disappointing that this is to happen but okay whatever at least I don't have to file a dispute. To be honest I was I was already thinking of calling my bank this morning and filing a
697.92,724.80,SPEAKER_02, dispute. Yes this is definitely not the experience that we want you to have but we will try our best to make this as easy as possible for you considering the situation. I will also keep this case in progress so whatever questions you might have during the investigation you just reply to the same email thread and I will be there to answer your questions. So let me get this straight. Seven business
724.80,735.12,SPEAKER_01, days for the investigation and if it is in found you're going to check with a team if it's available and if it's available another seven days to deliver the replacement. Yes Tabitha that's correct but
735.12,740.48,SPEAKER_02, of course if they find the parcel during the investigation then you don't need to wait that long
740.48,755.44,SPEAKER_01, that's already the maximum time frame. Yeah well I hope they do but I honestly don't have much hope for it but okay or a placement is fine I guess. Okay yeah I cannot guarantee that 100% that
755.44,768.24,SPEAKER_02, they would find your missing parcel but there have been cases in the past when they did find the missing parcel and I will of course update you throughout the process. Okay so I guess that's
768.24,784.32,SPEAKER_01, my best option. What do you need me to do just reply to your email saying that I didn't receive a parcel? That's correct I have just sent you the email. All right I will reply in five minutes I'm gonna have my lunch break. What's your name again? Candice. All right Candice thank you so much that's all
784.32,825.04,SPEAKER_02, I need for now I have to go bye. Enjoy your lunch Tabitha thank you for calling was Sean bye. All right as you can see this video is purely mock calls. If you want detailed explanations of all the things that Claire did wrong and Candice did right head over to this video at the top which will be available on my next upload. All right I think that's all that's all for today. It's really awkward vlogging outside but oh well I'm gonna get used to it so thank you for watching bye bye.
