0.00,8.72,SPEAKER_03," Doroda? Yeah. It's free. I like that. Isn't that cool? Yeah, that is cool. What are you doing?"
8.72,30.22,SPEAKER_01," Is there taking our voices and they're matching it to like computer sounds, computer numbers and digits so that they can use that for computer voices? Like a international calling. Oh, that's really cool. Yeah. How are you? I'm doing all right. Actually, I'm doing okay with them. I'm still, I still have my physical problems so it's really... What is that?"
30.22,94.24,SPEAKER_01," I don't know. I finally just, I had to leave my family doctor who I've been with for eight years because she just, I never had a, I've never had a problem before in my life and so I think having a physical challenge that she, she's just not good for that. She likes a quick fix and gives you some medicine and get you out of here. And I've been to three doctors since I've been back in the States and I'm going... What? Oh my God. Yeah, I'm still not better and I'm going to, I'm carrying a chronic infection every time I go in, there's no infection and I've been tested for AIDS, I've been tested for everything and it's nothing. They keep so far with these general practitioners and a couple kind of colleges. Anyway, so I'm going to see a bug guy this week for infectious diseases and hopefully they're gonna, they're really good. And I've changed my family doctor to somebody that Thomas Momma is a nurse and so she went through a whole list of doctors with me and we made a decision on who we were gonna work with and she found somebody she thinks is a perfectionist and, and so we'll see"
94.24,103.24,SPEAKER_03," what happens. Oh, good. Well, I hope you get it taken care of. Oh man. I got to let her and I was surprised to find out that you're still dealing with it. Oh man. And they check"
103.24,123.92,SPEAKER_01," me for diabetes. But I don't think the thing is is that they've been asturl as they need to be regarding things that I, they still want to keep saying it's a yeast infection or that it's bacteria and I've changed my diet. I've done all kinds of crazy stuff and, and I don't believe it's yeast. I think there's some sort of hidden other types of, of, of, of, my organism that they're not finding that I'm, I wouldn't have convinced about"
123.92,139.64,SPEAKER_03," it just pointed to me. Oh, well, I kind of would be too. Yeah. So long. So, how are you? Good. I just got back from the U.S. Yeah, I knew you, I thought so because it was just wedding everything. Yeah. How was it? It was really fun. It was a huge Polish ordeal."
139.64,145.12,SPEAKER_03," Uh huh. It was fun though. It was a good, good thing. A lot of fun. A lot of dancing."
145.12,157.32,SPEAKER_01," Uh huh. Big, big, huge wedding in like 270 guests. Oh my gosh. Yeah, it was huge. I was going to call you sooner but then I thought I thought she's just the time that her sister"
157.32,169.32,SPEAKER_03," was getting married. Yeah. It was right. Yeah. It was kind of a difficult thing. You know, you know, how it is. Uh huh. I guess I do. Did your sister visit? Did she come to"
169.32,180.92,SPEAKER_01," him? Yes, he did. And she hung out with Yola, the student. And I haven't heard from her yet. My sister has been back, I think, a couple days but I haven't heard from her."
180.92,191.32,SPEAKER_01, I called but I haven't gotten she doesn't get back to me yet. So I don't know. How are things at Tom? Groovy. Yeah. He's so nice to me. Yeah. Yeah.
191.32,230.02,SPEAKER_01," Well, that's when I hear wedding time. Yeah, we kind of chilled out. It was first it was just like we're going to do this. And then it was just too much pressure. It was just too much everything. Yeah. So, but you know, maybe someday. Because um, a pressing kind of spilled beans or something. Yeah. Yeah. Well, she called me a couple times when I got back which was very nice. Mm-hmm. Talk to me. What else did I want to tell you? Go ahead. Quick, quick. Quick. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. All right. Oh, good thing I need to ask you for favor but I know you've got your August group coming up pretty quick. Are they coming?"
230.02,241.72,SPEAKER_03," I think, yeah. They're coming August 2nd. Oh my God. How are you doing? Okay. I had a bit of a problem finding school but that's all done. So yeah, I don't have that much work."
241.72,253.90,SPEAKER_01," Really? Yeah. Cool. Could you do me a big favor? What's the favor? Well, I kind of need, I know, I know how you feel about this but could you do me a letter of reference?"
253.90,271.62,SPEAKER_01," Uh-huh. You can't? Well, I can, yeah, I can do. I mean, just to say that yes, I worked there in Poland and yes, it was okay. They have the people that I applied with already know the circumstances. They just want to verify some things in Poland. They called the US office. Of course, you know, they didn't get much information which is understandable."
271.62,298.50,SPEAKER_03," No, I'd be perfectly fine. I mean, you didn't do anything wrong. Good. You didn't get kicked out of the program. What I can do is just write a letter verifying your, which I've put participation in the program and you know, a little bit about what you did at the college, blah, blah, blah. You know? That's what you need, right? Yeah, I mean, maybe one nice thing said that you can do that. Well, I think I can find nice things to say."
298.50,313.66,SPEAKER_01," I'd rather, but you know, I'd rather be there with you. Do I edit yourself? No, no, no, because I know how you struggle. I was thinking about this yesterday. I know if I ask that she's probably going to sit there and go, oh, I need a word. I need, you know, you"
313.66,329.58,SPEAKER_02," would write things to you and ask me. I'm like, you know, ballerina going to the US and the Soviet Union. I need a word. I need a word that sprites that. Yeah, I'll write you with"
329.58,333.78,SPEAKER_03, you. Thank you. Do you have an address or something? I have a fax number without
333.78,379.86,SPEAKER_01," a word. Yes, I will work. Cool. I'll just like, I'll give you the number of the guy word to go directly because he's the one that needs to be. Okay, fax two. But we need to talk about something else in the meantime because I can't find it. I'm less than like, anyway, tell me, tell me other new things. I got a letter from John. He's like four or five pages. Oh, really? He writes really small. It's like getting a typed letter. Oh, I know. And told me, you know, that I don't know Linda was having a bad time or since then or I. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, this is a time. And then did some people leave? Did Kathy leave? Kathleen or just? No. No. Anyway, well, he was disappointed because I think you wanted to hang out with some people and he couldn't find them. Oh, I think Kathleen"
379.86,386.74,SPEAKER_03," probably left to travel around. Oh, that's what he probably met or dirt. Okay. Oh, here"
386.74,408.26,SPEAKER_01," it is. Okay. Uh, it's a 402. Uh-huh. 554. 554. 294. 9494949. What's the man's name? I can give him his Curtis K as in Cat U, R as in Rabbit T and Tulip I S as in something. Mm-hmm."
408.26,437.54,SPEAKER_01," His middle initial is D as in dog. Mm-hmm. And his last name is Freer King. It's F as in Frank R E R K I N G. Freer King. Wow. Weird name, huh? Curtis D. Freer King. Yep. He's with the University of Nebraska. Okay. What are you playing for? It's really cool. He's so he's making, he told me he was having a hard time making a decision and he said he really would like to get more information. I'm like, God, it's really cool. It's an ESL specialist."
437.54,468.34,SPEAKER_01," I think I wrote you about it. Teaching ESL, but it's teaching ESL to business people from Japan primarily. Uh-huh. But although they solicit, they're trying to solicit more throughout the globe instead of just Japan, although they've had most interest in Japan. And I teach probably two classes and then do administrative work to make connections for these people to have tours or to go look at companies dealing with certain issues that they're working on in the classes. Half of their classes are business, half are English. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm."
469.34,479.34,SPEAKER_01," So it's really groovy because I have all these contacts for them because of my experience in the business world here. Yeah, yeah. And, you know, I deal with teaching for them too."
479.34,487.34,SPEAKER_01, Okay. One classes did you teach at ports? I taught. I taught. I taught business English.
487.34,493.34,SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh. I taught listening. I taught integrated skills and beginning grammar. Okay.
494.34,497.34,SPEAKER_03, Mm-hmm. I'm just writing this down. So I...
497.34,501.34,SPEAKER_01," Cool. You don't have to tell them about pluckingopoly or anything. Oh, weird. You know what?"
501.34,529.30,SPEAKER_01," What? I had a dream this morning about... it's weird. I don't know if you were in it. I think you were. But Barry was definitely in it. Yeah. And Barry and I... I don't know if we were trying to get somewhere and we had to jump in this water, but she wouldn't like goals me when we got in the water and I woke up because it's her journey. I don't know what that means. I'm going to post her from her two the other day. Yeah. This is Gary Dream. It was pretty scary. I was kind of one of those"
529.30,535.30,SPEAKER_03," frustrating type dreams. Listen, was it difficult coming back? Going back to the left? Yeah."
535.30,551.30,SPEAKER_01," It was harder than I thought it would be actually. Harder in the sense that I wasn't used to the pace. It's, you know, the pace is totally different. And I didn't really want to see anybody for a while."
551.30,557.30,SPEAKER_01, And I didn't. Which was fine. And I really missed people from Poland because it was all my support system.
557.30,561.30,SPEAKER_01," Coming here, the only person I really knew and understood in my circumstances is Tom."
561.30,567.30,SPEAKER_01, And so that was really tough because there was a lot of pressure on both of us coming between with him again and all of that.
567.30,573.30,SPEAKER_01," Um, Lee's just seeing as far as Americanism. Blimpy scared me. Blimpy's that much place."
573.30,585.30,SPEAKER_01, I know. I know. That's pretty funny. We went in there and it was so yellow. It was so yellow and they wanted to help so bad.
589.30,595.30,SPEAKER_03," I just went back and I decided people are a bit too cheery in the US. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah."
595.30,611.30,SPEAKER_03," And do that wanting to help you so bad. Oh, my God. It just like ran into stores and ran out because I'd go on the weekdays when nobody, you know, because I had time off and I'd walk in there and like five people would say hello to me."
611.30,621.30,SPEAKER_03," We just like, like, hello. It's just. Oh, my God. It says, I talked to Kristin though when I was home. Yeah."
621.30,631.30,SPEAKER_03," I was so happy to be doing well. She's working. Which is good and she's got her, um, he helped me again. That's good. I think to be healthy again. Yeah."
631.30,642.30,SPEAKER_01," Hey, you know, I was going to tell you this thing that I got. Tom found this for me about this 3B experiment thing where you can do this and talk. And it was funny because he handed it to me and I was really confusing."
642.30,652.30,SPEAKER_01," So, is this something that contacted you on your email? Why? No, I told you about this last week. Oh, I'm looking at it because it had this guy and it and his name was his name is Mark."
652.30,659.30,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, no, yeah, Lindsey. And it said, and it was in it was his email thing and it said, you and I, whoo, Poland."
659.30,665.30,SPEAKER_01, And it was a playboy joke on this thing. It was done as an example of what we do.
665.30,679.30,SPEAKER_01," And it was so large. And I'm like, it's somebody trying to get a hold of you and he goes, no, I go, well, there's this thing. I said, look at this. And it, you know, it's all in code. And he goes, oh, weird. Because I didn't do that."
679.30,683.30,SPEAKER_03, That's really funny. Yeah.
683.30,688.30,SPEAKER_01," Yeah. And are you not smoking? No, yeah. Okay."
688.30,693.30,SPEAKER_03," Yeah, well, I did a few when I've been back to. Yeah, I've been smoking big time. It's in the rough couple months."
693.30,698.30,SPEAKER_03," Yeah. Well, yeah, the kids is doing the kids are doing the kids are doing the kids are doing."
698.30,703.30,SPEAKER_03," Well, no, not really that, but it's really busy as far as work is for sure. Yeah."
703.30,708.30,SPEAKER_03," No, sure. There's just like an email and I'm just, you know, wrapping things up so it's not that bad."
708.30,712.30,SPEAKER_03," But it was kind of hellish for a bit. Yeah, I'm sure."
712.30,717.30,SPEAKER_03," I still, all I want to do is sleep now. I've been trying to naps for the longest time today."
717.30,725.30,SPEAKER_03," Every time I lay down the phone rings and like random people call me, you're not that random, but it's kind of random receiving phone call from you."
725.30,726.30,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
726.30,733.30,SPEAKER_03," And you're not a random person, but, well, thank you. I appreciate being considered non random."
733.30,737.30,SPEAKER_03, Now you're pretty organized in order. Thank you.
737.30,738.30,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, well."
738.30,745.30,SPEAKER_03," Joe, do you going to be shocked that I heard from you? She what? She's going to be happy. Oh, yeah."
745.30,750.30,SPEAKER_01," Did you have a postcard from her? Yeah. No, I haven't heard from her."
750.30,753.30,SPEAKER_03, Just thought you postcard. It's not supposed to.
753.30,756.30,SPEAKER_01," Oh, right. You know what?"
756.30,760.30,SPEAKER_03," I just came back from the US and I have some letters for you, including that little package."
760.30,763.30,SPEAKER_03, I don't know what to do with that little package.
763.30,765.30,SPEAKER_03, It is Henna.
765.30,768.30,SPEAKER_01," Uh-huh. And I think, no, you know what I think you should do."
768.30,772.30,SPEAKER_01," Drota, please, really. The package of Henna."
772.30,774.30,SPEAKER_01, Share it with Magda.
774.30,778.30,SPEAKER_03, Magda's gone. Maybe I'll do it in my hair. Okay.
778.30,781.30,SPEAKER_03, It's a nice brown. Is it good? Yeah.
781.30,783.30,SPEAKER_01, All a friend of mine from Florida sent that to me.
783.30,784.30,SPEAKER_03, Yes.
784.30,786.30,SPEAKER_03," From Gainesville, Salabio, Florida."
786.30,788.30,SPEAKER_03, La vich.
788.30,790.30,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, boy, the leverage."
790.30,796.30,SPEAKER_01," Yeah. So, I would like to think that it goes to the cost because sending it back to me would probably just be ludicrous."
796.30,800.30,SPEAKER_03," So, you know, why don't you just, I'm opening up right now as you speak."
800.30,802.30,SPEAKER_03, It's like a world heat stamp on it.
802.30,804.30,SPEAKER_03, All right. All right.
804.30,809.30,SPEAKER_03," You know what? I've been saying, all right, all the time now."
809.30,813.30,SPEAKER_03," Okay. Conference in the US and you're like, where did you get that?"
813.30,816.30,SPEAKER_03," I'm like, that's a really long story."
816.30,821.30,SPEAKER_03," He there was a volunteer and she's, she's no this old man because she used to work thousands of men."
821.30,825.30,SPEAKER_03," She said there and say, all right."
825.30,829.30,SPEAKER_01, I have another one now too and Tom was really getting sick of it.
829.30,832.30,SPEAKER_01," What is it? Oh, it's another one of those."
832.30,833.30,SPEAKER_01, All right.
833.30,836.30,SPEAKER_01," Because he goes, what does that mean when I say it now?"
836.30,839.30,SPEAKER_01," It's like, I need to know more information."
839.30,842.30,SPEAKER_01, Just having all right isn't it now. Okay.
842.30,844.30,SPEAKER_01, All right.
844.30,846.30,SPEAKER_03, It's like catching in.
846.30,848.30,SPEAKER_03," It is. I mean, you know, hang it in."
848.30,851.30,SPEAKER_03," Yeah. So, but anyway, I want to come visit you."
851.30,852.30,SPEAKER_03, When?
852.30,853.30,SPEAKER_03, Next summer.
853.30,854.30,SPEAKER_03, I would love to.
854.30,856.30,SPEAKER_03, Except you're going to be gone.
856.30,858.30,SPEAKER_03," Well, I don't know how long I'm going to be here."
858.30,859.30,SPEAKER_03, Oh.
859.30,861.30,SPEAKER_03, What did you mean like early summer?
861.30,865.30,SPEAKER_01," Well, I mean, your job goes through when."
865.30,866.30,SPEAKER_01, July June?
866.30,867.30,SPEAKER_03, Okay.
867.30,868.30,SPEAKER_03, Sure. Yeah.
868.30,870.30,SPEAKER_03, I would love to be out of here before July.
870.30,871.30,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
871.30,872.30,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
872.30,875.30,SPEAKER_01, Because I really would kind of like to get there before you're gone.
875.30,876.30,SPEAKER_01, Before Joey's gone.
876.30,878.30,SPEAKER_01, Go to Warsaw one more time.
878.30,881.30,SPEAKER_03," Well, the city might have a job offer in Budapest."
881.30,882.30,SPEAKER_03," Oh, that's right."
882.30,883.30,SPEAKER_01, You're looking at that.
883.30,884.30,SPEAKER_01, Isn't that crazy?
884.30,885.30,SPEAKER_01, That's why.
885.30,888.30,SPEAKER_03," Yeah. I mean, if it's June, then that's fine."
888.30,890.30,SPEAKER_03, But then you might come back to the stage.
890.30,891.30,SPEAKER_03, When?
891.30,892.30,SPEAKER_03, Maybe.
892.30,893.30,SPEAKER_03, I don't know.
893.30,894.30,SPEAKER_01, When you're done.
894.30,895.30,SPEAKER_01, I don't know.
895.30,901.30,SPEAKER_03," I'm kind of, I was playing around with them working for the Olympics in Atlanta."
901.30,902.30,SPEAKER_03, Cool.

981.26,982.26,SPEAKER_01," Oh, yeah."
982.26,984.26,SPEAKER_01," For something like that, there's no reason."
984.26,985.26,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
985.26,990.26,SPEAKER_01," It looks like Tejas is completely an essential time zone, except for Alpasa, which you don't need."
990.26,991.26,SPEAKER_03," No, okay."
991.26,994.26,SPEAKER_01," So, um, I'm a real and all those crazy."
994.26,997.26,SPEAKER_03, Because I'm trying to decide whether I should wake up one of my new volunteers.

1036.26,1037.26,SPEAKER_01, It called total phone.
1037.26,1040.26,SPEAKER_01, It's like my phone card will tell me what it is.
1040.26,1045.26,SPEAKER_01," My card is priority, party calls, party calls, party calls, total phone."
1045.26,1046.26,SPEAKER_01, You have total phone.

1125.26,1126.26,SPEAKER_01," I, um, I got it myself."
1126.26,1128.26,SPEAKER_01, I want you to get access to a really awesome computer.

1132.26,1135.26,SPEAKER_01, And I can walk in there and use it and people are cool.
1135.26,1136.26,SPEAKER_03," Well, you know, girl?"
1136.26,1137.26,SPEAKER_03, Quicker.
1137.26,1141.26,SPEAKER_03," I am going to be an email, like probably by next week."

1148.26,1152.26,SPEAKER_03," I'm just trying to, um, I have some problems with it."
1152.26,1155.26,SPEAKER_03," And I'm, I'm, I'm finally connected with someone in their hospital."
1155.26,1157.26,, Don't you?
1157.26,1161.26,SPEAKER_01," Well, um, you know, use the hair stuff wisely."
1161.26,1162.26,SPEAKER_01, I don't know.
1162.26,1164.26,SPEAKER_01, I probably should let you go or something.
1164.26,1165.26,SPEAKER_01, Maybe you can call you again later.
1165.26,1166.26,SPEAKER_01, This is cool.
1166.26,1169.26,SPEAKER_01, I'm assuming you're more than all other people.
1169.26,1172.26,SPEAKER_03," You can, you can talk for however long you want."
1172.26,1173.26,SPEAKER_03, I think so.
1173.26,1175.26,SPEAKER_03," If not, I've got a phone to come in."
1175.26,1176.26,SPEAKER_03," Oh, I can't."
1176.26,1177.26,SPEAKER_03," Oh, okay."
1177.26,1180.26,SPEAKER_03," Yeah, that's good."
1180.26,1182.26,SPEAKER_01," No, but anyway, it was funny."
1182.26,1184.26,SPEAKER_01," How was like, uh huh."
1184.26,1186.26,SPEAKER_03," What, what this far as this letter is concerned."
1186.26,1188.26,SPEAKER_03, Can it wait till next week?
1188.26,1194.26,SPEAKER_03," Oh, well, I'm just asking what you're, um, I just knew the"
1194.26,1199.26,SPEAKER_01," better just because he, he needs help and they need to start teaching classes in 21st of August."
1199.26,1201.26,SPEAKER_01," And so he's really, he really wants to get done."
1201.26,1204.26,SPEAKER_01, And I think this is kind of a deciding factor for him.
1204.26,1205.26,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
1205.26,1208.26,SPEAKER_03," Um, let's just, I mean, I'll try to do it by then as this week."

1211.26,1212.26,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
1212.26,1213.26,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
1213.26,1214.26,SPEAKER_01, I'll let him know when to look for it.
1214.26,1216.26,SPEAKER_01, Otherwise he's probably going to be sitting there going with
1216.26,1218.26,SPEAKER_03, beta breath or something. No problem.
1218.26,1219.26,SPEAKER_01, But the latest on Monday.

1222.26,1224.26,SPEAKER_01, He was a week of smoke and he can give me a big hug.
1224.26,1225.26,SPEAKER_01," Oh, it was so weird."
1225.26,1226.26,SPEAKER_01, I got to tell you the day.
1226.26,1227.26,SPEAKER_01, We had a cloudy day as well.
1227.26,1232.26,SPEAKER_01," Since I remember about three weeks ago, but still, it's quite a way since I've been into the United States right here."
1232.26,1233.26,SPEAKER_01," You know, living here."
1233.26,1241.26,SPEAKER_01," And I woke up and I was kind of cloudy, day and I wasn't, you know, how you're in that fog when you first get up in the morning."
1241.26,1242.26,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1242.26,1245.26,SPEAKER_01," And I thought, oh gosh, I think I'll go to war side of day."
1245.26,1250.26,SPEAKER_01," And I went, wait a minute, no, no, I can't do that."
1250.26,1254.26,SPEAKER_01," Oh, and then it was just a few weeks ago."
1254.26,1255.26,SPEAKER_01, Oh my God.
1255.26,1256.26,SPEAKER_01," You know, something."
1256.26,1258.26,SPEAKER_01, Don't think about it and dream about it.
1258.26,1260.26,SPEAKER_03," Oh, well, you'll be here next summer."
1260.26,1261.26,SPEAKER_01, It's good water.
1261.26,1262.26,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1262.26,1263.26,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1263.26,1264.26,SPEAKER_01, I hope so.
1264.26,1265.26,SPEAKER_01, As long as I get a job and I can pay for it.
1265.26,1267.26,SPEAKER_01," So if you do this letter, that means I have money."
1267.26,1268.26,SPEAKER_01, That means I can come.
1268.26,1269.26,SPEAKER_01, All right.
1269.26,1270.26,SPEAKER_01, All right.

1283.26,1286.26,SPEAKER_03, Did we discuss anything we should discuss?
1286.26,1287.26,SPEAKER_01, I don't think so.
1287.26,1288.26,SPEAKER_03, All right.
1288.26,1289.26,SPEAKER_01, I'd expect you to hand that thing.
1289.26,1291.26,SPEAKER_01, And I don't think that's that person.
1291.26,1292.26,SPEAKER_01, No.
1292.26,1293.26,SPEAKER_01," No, no, no."
1293.26,1294.26,SPEAKER_01, All right.
