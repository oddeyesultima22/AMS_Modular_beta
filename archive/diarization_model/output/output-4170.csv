149.80,150.80,SPEAKER_02, So around five thirty.
150.80,151.80,SPEAKER_04, Ooh.
151.80,152.80,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
152.80,154.80,SPEAKER_04, How long can you do it to work?
154.80,155.80,SPEAKER_02, That's not long.
155.80,157.80,SPEAKER_02, It's only like 15 or 20 minutes.
157.80,158.80,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
158.80,161.80,SPEAKER_02, So that's for me to drive to work.
161.80,164.80,SPEAKER_02, That's not that bad.
164.80,166.80,SPEAKER_02, But what else?
166.80,170.80,SPEAKER_02, Didn't even exciting with me.
170.80,175.80,SPEAKER_02, You kind of caught me in a half days state.
175.80,178.80,SPEAKER_04, What do you give the phone over to Dino when you're done?
178.80,180.80,SPEAKER_02," No, but my eyes are getting pretty heavy."
180.80,184.80,SPEAKER_04, I want my half hours worth out of this call.
184.80,185.80,SPEAKER_04, Okay.
185.80,186.80,SPEAKER_02, I'll try my phone.
186.80,187.80,SPEAKER_04, I'll give our expenses on.

189.80,190.80,SPEAKER_02, It's our best right now.
190.80,192.80,SPEAKER_02," Well, how come you're not out drinking?"
192.80,193.80,SPEAKER_04, Yeah.
193.80,199.80,SPEAKER_04," I was basically at paid last week or whatever, whatever, what I thought."
199.80,200.80,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
200.80,203.80,SPEAKER_04," And something happened where they're like, because they stopped paying me for a while."
203.80,205.80,SPEAKER_04, So I have to wait two weeks.
205.80,208.80,SPEAKER_04, So I want to take some money out of my Mac on like Wednesday.
208.80,209.80,SPEAKER_04, And it's an insufficient fund.
209.80,210.80,SPEAKER_04," And I'm like, what the hell is that?"
210.80,212.80,SPEAKER_04, I should have like $650 in there.
212.80,217.80,SPEAKER_04," So I call up and they're like, well, you won't be paid until not this Monday, but next Monday, like we'll be in your cap."
217.80,225.80,SPEAKER_04," So then I call my parents to that yesterday and they could send me some money like $200, $100 to keep the Mac open and $100 for groceries and other stuff the next week and a half."
225.80,226.80,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
226.80,235.80,SPEAKER_04," And then I'd give them a check in like two weeks for the 200, but it ended up that it didn't go through or something because I tried to use the Mac tonight."
235.80,237.80,SPEAKER_02, It's basically your broke.
237.80,240.80,SPEAKER_04, Basically I have whatever loose change I have.
240.80,243.80,SPEAKER_02, That's worse than me.
243.80,244.80,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
244.80,246.80,SPEAKER_04, I couldn't even do laundry because I don't have quarters.
246.80,251.80,SPEAKER_04, And I have no money to take a $10 bill out and get changed.
251.80,252.80,SPEAKER_02, Pretty sad job.
252.80,253.80,SPEAKER_04," Yeah, it is."
253.80,255.80,SPEAKER_04," Well, I'm kind of angry about that."
255.80,256.80,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
256.80,258.80,SPEAKER_02," Well, that's what you're doing this free phone call thing."
258.80,259.80,SPEAKER_04," Well, there you go."
259.80,261.80,SPEAKER_04," Now, well, it's technically, technically I have the money."
261.80,263.80,SPEAKER_04, It's just I can't touch it.
263.80,264.80,SPEAKER_04, Yeah.
264.80,268.80,SPEAKER_04," So we'll fix that at the next pay period, I guess."
268.80,272.80,SPEAKER_02," But yeah, I just got paid today."
272.80,275.80,SPEAKER_04," Yeah, I spent three and a half hours yesterday walking around our chest."
275.80,276.80,SPEAKER_02, Did it.
276.80,278.80,SPEAKER_04," Yeah, my friend Rebecca once he came to me Spanish."
278.80,280.80,SPEAKER_04, I was learning Spanish words for things.
280.80,281.80,SPEAKER_04, So we're going around.
281.80,282.80,SPEAKER_04," Oh, man."
282.80,283.80,SPEAKER_02, I'm so jealous.
283.80,284.80,SPEAKER_04, It was like 90.
284.80,285.80,SPEAKER_04," Yeah, I don't know."
285.80,287.80,SPEAKER_04, It was a temperature down there.
287.80,289.80,SPEAKER_02, It's like really damn hot.
289.80,291.80,SPEAKER_04, We were like in the 90s up here.
291.80,295.80,SPEAKER_04, So we were out looking at our surface at like four o'clock.
295.80,296.80,SPEAKER_04, Yeah.
296.80,299.80,SPEAKER_04," You till like seven, 30 or something like that yesterday."
299.80,303.80,SPEAKER_04, And I talk about how I mean everybody was sweating out there.
303.80,305.80,SPEAKER_02, That's what people tend to do when it's really hot shot.
305.80,306.80,SPEAKER_04, Yeah.
306.80,312.80,SPEAKER_04," Well, it's kind of weird because we've been having stuff like like really I didn't need to use my air conditioner really in my room."
312.80,313.80,SPEAKER_04, Like most of the summer.
313.80,317.80,SPEAKER_04, It's like all of a sudden we have this huge jump up into the 90s.
317.80,318.80,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
318.80,321.80,SPEAKER_04, So was it sudden for you guys or was it just?
321.80,323.80,SPEAKER_02," No, it's like all the time."
323.80,324.80,SPEAKER_04, Yeah.
324.80,325.80,SPEAKER_04, You got your pool.
325.80,327.80,SPEAKER_02, And then we're going to get to going at though.
327.80,329.80,SPEAKER_04, It was a little Stephen bin in it.
329.80,330.80,SPEAKER_02, No.
330.80,332.80,SPEAKER_02," No, we were probably by the end of summer."
332.80,333.80,SPEAKER_02, We'll get him in.
333.80,334.80,SPEAKER_04, Uh huh.
334.80,335.80,SPEAKER_04, I heard you can teach a kid to swim.
335.80,337.80,SPEAKER_04, Maybe to swim.
337.80,341.80,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, actually I think Tina can have a book out of the library on that."
341.80,346.80,SPEAKER_02, I don't know if I could get it out again.
346.80,347.80,SPEAKER_04, Try it out.
347.80,349.80,SPEAKER_04, How you know what else I heard with little guys.
349.80,350.80,SPEAKER_04, I hear a friendly.

351.80,352.80,SPEAKER_02, I'm just being a pain in the air.
352.80,358.80,SPEAKER_04, I heard that they can develop that like that perfect pitch or whatever when they're young.
358.80,359.80,SPEAKER_02, Perfect what?
359.80,360.80,SPEAKER_04, Pitch.
360.80,361.80,SPEAKER_04, Pitch.
361.80,363.80,SPEAKER_04," Yeah, perfect pitch like I'm baseball."
363.80,364.80,SPEAKER_04," No, like music."
364.80,365.80,SPEAKER_04, Oh.
365.80,371.80,SPEAKER_04," So like if you like, I get like one of those little toys or something to play the scale or something like that."
371.80,373.80,SPEAKER_04, Everyone's about to play that or just at least play music.
373.80,375.80,SPEAKER_04, They can develop it a real good year.
375.80,376.80,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.

429.80,432.80,SPEAKER_04, Did you guys get a chance to go out and use them as babysitters?
432.80,435.80,SPEAKER_02, No not really because they need this breastfeeding.
435.80,437.80,SPEAKER_02, So we couldn't do that.
437.80,438.80,SPEAKER_02, Mm.
438.80,442.80,SPEAKER_02, We're at the mercy of just feeding schedule.

532.80,533.80,SPEAKER_04," So it's kind of, it's kind of nice."
533.80,535.80,SPEAKER_04," I mean, it's really crowded here in town now."
535.80,536.80,SPEAKER_04, Yeah.
536.80,537.80,SPEAKER_04," Cause everybody, it seems like everybody's up."
537.80,539.80,SPEAKER_02," But, uh, man, probably like nobody."
539.80,542.80,SPEAKER_02, I really know it was not like a lot of people I know are there.
542.80,543.80,SPEAKER_04," Oh, sure."
543.80,546.80,SPEAKER_02, I don't know if fraternity brothers are up there.
546.80,548.80,SPEAKER_02, I don't know if that haven't seen for two years.
548.80,551.80,SPEAKER_04," Well, you can go another decade without seeing them."
551.80,563.80,SPEAKER_02," Um, um, um, but hey, when we, uh, when we come up for Thanksgiving, the week before Thanksgiving, uh, probably what we'll do."
563.80,564.80,SPEAKER_02, Do you know what you're playing there?
564.80,566.80,SPEAKER_02," Like, well, you, you don't know really."
566.80,567.80,SPEAKER_04," Oh, I'm getting a car."

571.30,572.30,SPEAKER_02," Oh, yeah."
572.30,573.30,SPEAKER_02, I think that.
573.30,576.30,SPEAKER_04," Oh, you heard, uh, she's, I didn't even know that."
576.30,577.30,SPEAKER_04, You probably knew before I did.
577.30,578.30,SPEAKER_02," Oh, yeah, long before."
578.30,580.30,SPEAKER_02, I was from other tell you.
580.30,588.30,SPEAKER_04," Uh, I wish they, I wish somebody would have because my dad like told me like the weekend that I could have gone home with Boga and gotten it."
588.30,589.30,SPEAKER_04," Cause he's not going home like,"
589.30,590.30,SPEAKER_01, I'm telling you that.
590.30,593.30,SPEAKER_04," Uh, he told me last Saturday. Yeah."
593.30,595.30,SPEAKER_04," And Dave left, you know, Friday to go home."
595.30,599.30,SPEAKER_04," Uh, So then I called Dave up this weekend like Dave, like, well, he's not going home this weekend for our test."

600.30,602.30,SPEAKER_04, He's not going home next weekend.
602.30,607.30,SPEAKER_04," And, uh, so it's like, you know, like, I, if I get a car, it can be like by like the 30th of July or something."
607.30,610.30,SPEAKER_04, Your dad should come up and pick you up and bring you home.
610.30,612.30,SPEAKER_02, And then you can drive the car back.
612.30,615.30,SPEAKER_04," Well, I would want to put that much extra miles on my car."
615.30,618.30,SPEAKER_04, I think it's got like 150 or 160 or something as it is.
618.30,620.30,SPEAKER_02," 160,000 miles."
620.30,621.30,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.

653.30,654.30,SPEAKER_04, Yeah.
654.30,657.30,SPEAKER_04," And I saw my, if she wants to go home, I could say like, Oh, we can go hang out around Philadelphia."
657.30,660.30,SPEAKER_04, We can hang out with Lynn and her boyfriend and stuff like that.
660.30,663.30,SPEAKER_04, And then we can just come home after the next day and I can get my car.
663.30,665.30,SPEAKER_03," So, So,"

698.30,699.30,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
699.30,701.30,SPEAKER_04," Like every time there's a home one, I don't understand that."

719.30,720.30,SPEAKER_04," Oh, that'd be good."
720.30,725.30,SPEAKER_04," But, they said that the Cincinnati is going to adjust the total offense for Kajana Carter."
725.30,726.30,SPEAKER_02, That'd be cool.

742.30,744.30,SPEAKER_04, That'd better be broadcast everywhere.
744.30,745.30,SPEAKER_04, I think it is.
745.30,746.30,SPEAKER_02, That'd be cool.
746.30,747.30,SPEAKER_04," Now, I got things."
747.30,748.30,SPEAKER_04, It's like a lens TV.
748.30,749.30,SPEAKER_04, I got cable.

752.30,753.30,SPEAKER_02," Now,"
753.30,756.30,SPEAKER_04, What other things can I tell you? I bought a mechanical engineering book.
756.30,757.30,SPEAKER_02," Oh, that's exciting."
757.30,760.30,SPEAKER_04, I think you're proud of me because you probably have it.
760.30,761.30,SPEAKER_02," No, I've already sold it."
761.30,762.30,SPEAKER_02, I've heard money.
762.30,763.30,SPEAKER_02, I've heard money.
763.30,764.30,SPEAKER_02, I've heard money.
764.30,766.30,SPEAKER_02, I've had the idea of the semester.
766.30,767.30,SPEAKER_02," So,"
767.30,771.30,SPEAKER_04, Now I got this one because it's got everything in it that I need for structural engineering.
771.30,772.30,SPEAKER_02, What?
772.30,773.30,SPEAKER_04, What is it?
773.30,775.30,SPEAKER_04, It's like for your e-meck O5-1 or something.
775.30,777.30,SPEAKER_04, Mechanical design.
777.30,780.30,SPEAKER_02, I think I did sell that.
780.30,783.30,SPEAKER_04, But it's got the reason I bought it was because it's got strength and materials.
783.30,786.30,SPEAKER_04, It's got more circle and engineering mechanics in it.
786.30,788.30,SPEAKER_04, And a bunch of other stuff like I need all in one book.
788.30,790.30,SPEAKER_02, Basically a bunch of crap that you never use.
790.30,791.30,SPEAKER_04, I use it.
791.30,792.30,SPEAKER_04, Yeah.
792.30,793.30,SPEAKER_04, Yeah.
793.30,796.30,SPEAKER_04, I use some interesting stuff in my work.
796.30,797.30,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
797.30,805.30,SPEAKER_04, But I've been spending all week trying to figure out about fiber Bond adhesion with steel fibers to concrete.
805.30,808.30,SPEAKER_04, So that was kind of exciting for my thesis.
808.30,812.30,SPEAKER_02," Hey, if you look up exciting in the dictionary, that's what it says."
812.30,813.30,SPEAKER_04," I'll tell you,"
813.30,819.30,SPEAKER_02, Steel fibers being bound to concrete. What more could you possibly want?
819.30,822.30,SPEAKER_04, What else is exciting that goes on during Arts Fest that you remember up here?
822.30,824.30,SPEAKER_04," Besides just everybody being up here, I guess."
824.30,826.30,SPEAKER_04, Because not everybody I know is up here.
826.30,828.30,SPEAKER_02, It's just everyone being up there basically.
828.30,831.30,SPEAKER_02, I guess it's a big party because everyone's back.
831.30,834.30,SPEAKER_04, Because it's mutual expenses here.
834.30,835.30,SPEAKER_02, Everything.
835.30,837.30,SPEAKER_02, The price is chopped up for everything.
837.30,842.30,SPEAKER_04," Well, what I saw, you know, just buying a gift or something, even just a coffee mug or something."
842.30,845.30,SPEAKER_04, The minimum price this year seems to be $20.
845.30,846.30,SPEAKER_04, Oh my god.
846.30,848.30,SPEAKER_04," You know, like we're back with the food."
848.30,849.30,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
849.30,853.30,SPEAKER_04, Rebecca was looking at some stuff that she wants to get gifts for her brothers.
853.30,854.30,SPEAKER_02, The food.
854.30,855.30,SPEAKER_02, The food.
855.30,856.30,SPEAKER_02, B-O-O-T-H-F.
856.30,861.30,SPEAKER_04," Anyway, so Rebecca's family's coming up from Venezuela at the end of the month."
861.30,863.30,SPEAKER_04, That she wanted to get them all like gifts and stuff.
863.30,867.30,SPEAKER_04," So we're like looking around and like, she found like one thing I thought it was kind of a good."
867.30,872.30,SPEAKER_04," It was like some like little pottery thing of a little face, but it was like 10, 10 or 15 bucks."
872.30,877.30,SPEAKER_04, But the average thing I was saying like just even just like a coffee mug or even pictures were like 20 bucks.
877.30,878.30,SPEAKER_04, Like little pictures.
878.30,879.30,SPEAKER_04, Yeah.
879.30,880.30,SPEAKER_04, But didn't even look that good.
880.30,882.30,SPEAKER_04, So I'll picture I really loved.
882.30,883.30,SPEAKER_04, Yeah.
883.30,884.30,, 190.
884.30,885.30,SPEAKER_02," Oh, that'd be."
885.30,890.30,SPEAKER_02," That'd be so cool if we could, if we were up there and could get something for our house."
890.30,891.30,SPEAKER_04, Yeah.
891.30,892.30,SPEAKER_04, No.
892.30,893.30,SPEAKER_04, How you want me to pick you out something?
893.30,894.30,SPEAKER_04, You can.
894.30,896.30,SPEAKER_04, I'm kidding.
896.30,899.30,SPEAKER_04, There's not the theme this year seems to be.
899.30,901.30,SPEAKER_04, It looks like a picture.
901.30,905.30,SPEAKER_04, The theme this year seems to be booze with just pictures.
905.30,908.30,SPEAKER_04," As Rebecca said, dad clothing."
908.30,913.30,SPEAKER_04, And lots of glasses and dishes.
913.30,916.30,SPEAKER_04, And what was the other theme?
916.30,919.30,SPEAKER_04," I think that was, there was pretty much the major themes."
919.30,921.30,SPEAKER_04," Just about like, oh, and jewelry."
921.30,922.30,SPEAKER_02, Sure.
922.30,923.30,SPEAKER_04, Yeah.
923.30,924.30,SPEAKER_04," But I mean, this is like regular."
924.30,926.30,SPEAKER_04, A lot of the jewelry looked like mall jewelry.
926.30,927.30,SPEAKER_04, It wasn't the cool stuff.
927.30,929.30,SPEAKER_04," Like, I mean, not mall."
929.30,930.30,SPEAKER_04, You know what I mean?
930.30,931.30,SPEAKER_04," Like, you see like a ring."
931.30,933.30,SPEAKER_04, It's just a piece of metal.
933.30,934.30,SPEAKER_04," Like, you know, it's just silver."
934.30,936.30,SPEAKER_04, It's not that fancy about it.
936.30,938.30,SPEAKER_04," Like, I used to like look at the things."
938.30,940.30,SPEAKER_04," Like the inter, like made by like an artist."
940.30,941.30,SPEAKER_04," You know, where they put things together."
941.30,943.30,SPEAKER_04, They make little shapes that they have etchings in it and stuff.
943.30,945.30,SPEAKER_04, And really intricate work.
945.30,946.30,SPEAKER_04, Yeah.
946.30,949.30,SPEAKER_04," But a lot of this stuff is just plain like, you know, like a ring with a rock in it."
949.30,950.30,SPEAKER_04, Yeah.
950.30,951.30,SPEAKER_04," You know, something like that."
951.30,952.30,SPEAKER_04, I don't think that's that exciting.
952.30,958.30,SPEAKER_04," Because I like to see some of the, I mean, they got some really interesting art things in some spots up here."
958.30,961.30,SPEAKER_02," How's your woman, John?"
961.30,962.30,SPEAKER_02, Anything?
962.30,963.30,SPEAKER_04, Don't ask.
963.30,964.30,SPEAKER_02, Don't ask.
964.30,969.30,SPEAKER_04," I got, she has like, I was, you know, I was writing her like every week."
969.30,970.30,SPEAKER_04, Yeah.
970.30,971.30,SPEAKER_04, And calling.
971.30,974.30,SPEAKER_04," So I just figured I'd see, you know, what would happen if I didn't write her call."
974.30,981.30,SPEAKER_04," Well, it's been over two weeks and I have, I have not heard from her either by phone or by mail."
981.30,984.30,SPEAKER_02," Maybe she's sitting there saying, no, John doesn't care."
984.30,985.30,SPEAKER_02, He's stopped writing.
985.30,994.30,SPEAKER_04," Well, see, I don't understand why, why I'm always perceived as not caring by my girlfriend's when I like constantly send letters and never forget the call."
994.30,995.30,SPEAKER_04," But if they don't,"
995.30,1004.30,SPEAKER_02, that's because most people aren't as persistent as you are with writing and calling and all that.
1004.30,1011.30,SPEAKER_04," Yeah, I don't know. I just, I just don't feel like writing all these letters and just having, like, when she, you know, she's not writing backward."
1011.30,1016.30,SPEAKER_04," I just don't feel like seeing her the first day she comes back, moving in with her, her boyfriend helping her move this stuff back in."
1016.30,1017.30,SPEAKER_04, Yeah.
1017.30,1020.30,SPEAKER_04," So, new topic."
1020.30,1021.30,SPEAKER_04, New topic.
1021.30,1022.30,SPEAKER_02, New topic.
1022.30,1023.30,SPEAKER_02, Enough of that.
1023.30,1025.30,SPEAKER_04, Even as a girlfriend.
1025.30,1026.30,SPEAKER_02, Dussie.
1026.30,1027.30,SPEAKER_04, Yeah.
1027.30,1028.30,SPEAKER_04, Hell.
1028.30,1029.30,SPEAKER_02, Her name's Maria.
1029.30,1030.30,SPEAKER_02, She lives across the street.
1030.30,1031.30,SPEAKER_04," Ah, how old are you?"
1031.30,1032.30,SPEAKER_02, Maria.
1032.30,1033.30,SPEAKER_04, 40 is old.
1033.30,1034.30,SPEAKER_04, Ooh.
1034.30,1035.30,SPEAKER_04, Are she cute?
1035.30,1036.30,SPEAKER_02, Is she a looker?
1036.30,1037.30,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, she's a lot of hair."
1037.30,1038.30,SPEAKER_04," Oh, there you go."
1038.30,1039.30,SPEAKER_02, Our hair.
1039.30,1040.30,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1040.30,1044.30,SPEAKER_02," So, they were introduced for the first time yesterday."
1044.30,1045.30,SPEAKER_04, No.
1045.30,1048.30,SPEAKER_04," So, I guess Maria was sleeping a lot."
1048.30,1049.30,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1049.30,1050.30,SPEAKER_04," So, Stephen actually."
1050.30,1051.30,SPEAKER_02, Really.
1051.30,1054.30,SPEAKER_02," Well, I heard they'd just lay in there with the,"
1054.30,1057.30,SPEAKER_04," most people, it was like six, eight weeks before they really started."
1057.30,1058.30,SPEAKER_02," Right, he was awake."
1058.30,1059.30,SPEAKER_04, Started to get interactive.
1059.30,1060.30,SPEAKER_02, How long?
1060.30,1063.30,SPEAKER_04," Like six, eight weeks before they really started to get interactive. Stephen's interactive."
1063.30,1064.30,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1064.30,1065.30,SPEAKER_02, He's multimedia.

1231.18,1269.14,SPEAKER_04, that it's been really comfortable up here like uh... i think it has this is the first to me it actually felt like a summer you know i mean like what i remember summer's a little kid like when you're laying in bed and you're sweating and stuff at night this is the first time it's it felt like that because you go outside i think it's like oh yeah i keep run twenty four hours a day it's like i'm like a computer in here so but also it's like that on low it doesn't work that great yeah so it just keeps the room comfortable it's not like freezing and it's not like a window job uh... it's like a wall thing it's a little hole cutting the wall for it little wall unit but i have complete control of it
1269.14,1272.10,SPEAKER_00, okay i remember yeah okay i know you mean
1272.10,1276.50,SPEAKER_04, and uh... so i mean it the room is nice i got to clean it
1276.50,1279.06,SPEAKER_00, well you better get your act together and clean
1279.06,1284.22,SPEAKER_04, uh... i would require organizing some of my thesis work and stuff which

1309.82,1312.82,SPEAKER_00, that's right it can just go ahead and there you go
1312.82,1315.18,SPEAKER_04, what we use in before to do the laundry
1315.18,1330.42,SPEAKER_00, well we had a washer and dryer but our dryer was like this real everything a little small ones like a partner's eyes or something and i've actually done i like half the size of the normal dryer and it was getting to be a pain because you can't really put much in it
1330.42,1331.66,SPEAKER_04, what i can imagine
1331.66,1337.10,SPEAKER_00, so and our washing machine was it wasn't old old but i mean i bought it from someone
1337.10,1340.26,SPEAKER_04, i think you got that you got that you got that you got that you got married
1340.26,1344.74,SPEAKER_00, yeah well it wasn't new it was just like stuff that we bought it
1344.74,1347.14,SPEAKER_04, and i said somebody i thought somebody bought you a washing dryer
1347.14,1357.98,SPEAKER_00, now no no no no unfortunately not so it's what tom's boss person left and moved to do tom time about this
1357.98,1359.30,SPEAKER_03, yeah
1359.30,1399.18,SPEAKER_00, he's been out and if he's heard him talk about eric but he like quit his job and is moving to california and starting some business or something i don't know but tom can still be doing that some other time i guess cuz i don't know all the details uh-huh but anyway he had to sell i was pumped that that's about it he had to sell everything that he had on basically because he was just taking what he could fit in his car and he's not going to be making any money for six months i guess he needs the money and i was watching the washing dryer and it was hooked up yesterday so i said all day today doing laundry that took a flight when of my day but it was so exciting because i have this like huge dryer on this huge washing machine and now
1399.18,1404.36,SPEAKER_04, you catch your work in half i'll tell you i i i i would i wouldn't mind having my own washing

1516.56,1518.64,SPEAKER_04, dishwasher stuff like that
