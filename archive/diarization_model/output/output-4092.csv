0.00,14.40,SPEAKER_03," Yeah, oh okay. Oh, but I'm not interrupting there. No, not at all. What time is it?"
14.40,20.08,SPEAKER_05," I think it's 7-15 your time. No, absolutely not. Do you guys need it like 10?"
20.08,48.24,SPEAKER_05," No, it's not 7-15. Isn't it 5 hours later? Yeah, that's 12-15 my time. I was supposed 5-15. Yeah, yeah. A little float today. Yeah, oh. That's the 4th of July. What are you doing at work? I'm not at work. I went home. Oh, that's good. Yeah. We just got back from the gym. Oh, good. Uh-huh. How's it going? Oh, pretty well. It was really crowded today. Yeah, I kind of assumed"
48.24,74.48,SPEAKER_03," everyone would be at the shore. Uh-huh. Well it's the middle of the week or whatever. So, but it's the 4th of July. Mm. So, man, people still worked tomorrow. Did you have a walk yesterday? Yes. Oh, that's good. And it was paid too. Oh, it's a paid today? No. But uh, yeah, so the gym's going well. Oh,"
75.68,113.52,SPEAKER_05," but I still need to go more often. Well, how often are you going? Only four days a week. Mm-hmm. Got to get that up to five. Mm-hmm. But I don't really like going with Anne Mike because she doesn't like to stay very long. Why? I don't know. She kind of, unfortunately for some reason she's not like into cardiovascular. So, when I'm still riding the bike, she's completely finished her weightlifting routine. And like I haven't even started mine. Mm-hmm. You know, when I kind of hinted to her that really the only way to lose weight is cardiovascular. Mm-hmm. True."
113.52,120.08,SPEAKER_05," Lifting the weights won't lose weight. You know, but... No, I mean, you might lose some, but that's"
120.08,137.44,SPEAKER_03," the only way for a woman who's lifting not that much. I don't think you would. I mean, yeah, the only thing is just getting your heart rate up for extended periods of time. Yeah, so, I don't know. Maybe she'll catch on soon. You do burn a lot of calories an hour though, lifting weights."
138.40,141.92,SPEAKER_03," But yeah, I mean, you're not gonna, I don't think you're gonna lose that much."
141.92,146.64,SPEAKER_05, And also lifting weights at Bally's means you're standing online as far as much time as you're
146.64,154.72,SPEAKER_03," actually lifting. Really? Yeah. That's true, Ben. Yeah. So it's really overcrowded. Well, I mean,"
154.72,164.08,SPEAKER_05," obviously since I work, I can't get there until about six o'clock at night, which is when everyone else gets there. Mm-hmm. But I mean, I'm sure for people who go in the daytime, it's probably dead."
164.80,169.52,SPEAKER_05," Yeah. You know, and I go, like when I go Saturday and Sunday mornings, it's totally dead."
171.52,182.24,SPEAKER_05," So, but you know, the weeknight is pretty crazy. Yeah. Yeah. So I found a gym yesterday here that's"
182.24,202.48,SPEAKER_03," only eight pounds a month, which is like $12, $12.50. Wow. Yeah, it's at the hospital nearby. Well, that's a deal. Yeah. Yeah. So I think tonight Charlie and I are gonna go over and join up. Even Charlie's gonna join? No, but it has to be debited from my bank account. So it's"
202.48,209.44,SPEAKER_05," gonna be debited from this. And your letter, you said that he eats constantly. Oh, my God. Really?"
210.00,264.40,SPEAKER_03," Alice, I've never seen anybody eat as much as he does. He's so skinny. I mean, the amount of cereal he eats like between meals and after meals. Yeah. And we go through a box of cereal every two days. Really? Yeah. He totally looks for both a cereal a day, like in addition to like meals. And when he goes to work, he brings four sandwiches with him, bag of potato chips, and then little sweetie things, chocolate and cakey and stuff like that. And then, you know, before he leaves every morning, he has like two fried eggs on toast with cheese, vegetarian sausages, and like fruit and it's just crazy. It's crazy how much he eats. He was probably starving when he was here."
265.12,270.96,SPEAKER_03," Yeah, I think what we've got to do is just when he comes, just have lots of cereal. He likes cocoa"
270.96,283.04,SPEAKER_05, pots. Wow. That's pretty crazy. Yeah. It's all about being a blue collar man. I guess so.
283.04,287.60,SPEAKER_03," There's one who can eat all day. Really? Well, I mean, it does work as I've also. Yeah."
287.76,297.60,SPEAKER_05," I assume it's hard for you not to eat as much as he is. No, I'm going to quick fast in a hurry"
297.60,301.84,SPEAKER_03," because I've gained so much weight. Oh, really? Yeah. I'm saying the first week I was here,"
302.72,307.44,SPEAKER_05," I gained a lot. Well, it's hard to, you know, not eat when somebody else is eating here. Well,"
308.32,330.48,SPEAKER_03, I'm figuring it out fast. I'm not working out. No. Yeah. It's pretty miserable. My current state I called this woman today and she's a dress maker and I'm going to go see her next Thursday and talk about her making my wedding dress. Slight green. Yeah. See that way I can have exactly what I want.
330.48,343.12,SPEAKER_03," Exactly. And it's only like, it's only going to be about Â£250, which is about $350. So that's pretty good. I mean, comparatively. Yeah. And it'll be exactly what I want and it'll look good on me."
343.36,348.16,SPEAKER_03," You know, like, fit me. Sure. Which is necessary at the moment because I'm pulling."
350.72,370.32,SPEAKER_05," Now, dad is at the invitations together for you today. Uh huh. And in it, I put paint samples from Sherwood Williams of all the different like shades of what color I thought you might be thinking of for the bridesmaids. Uh huh. Oh, I already told them all black,"
370.32,380.56,SPEAKER_03," but dad doesn't want black. You said, mom and dad won't have black. So they don't want black? They really opposed to it. Did you call Sharon and tell her that? No. Could you do that? Okay."
380.56,387.20,SPEAKER_03," Could you call Kate and tell her that? Yeah. Just, you know, my parents are really opposed to black."
387.20,399.44,SPEAKER_03," They won't buy me a black dress. They won't. Let me look for my phone book. No, never mind. I can just open the thing here. Now we've got so much furniture in this tiny apartment. It's crazy."
401.36,406.80,SPEAKER_03," There's doors everywhere. Okay, let me give you Kate's phone number. You can just leave a message."
406.88,422.16,SPEAKER_03," Okay. Two, one, two, one, two, two, two, two, six. Uh huh. Oh, one, two, five. Okay. Okay, I'll do that."
423.60,470.48,SPEAKER_05," But apparently like at least a minute, she's wedding. Like the whole night people were talking about how bad the black dresses were. Really? Like everyone at mom and dad's table. Yeah, who was that mom and dad's table? Just all of Lorraine's friends. Mm-hmm. Who, you know, of course most of a mom and dad had at least met once before. Mm-hmm. But uh, yeah. And Adele still talks about the black dress. What? How hideous they were. But Del was not at least a minute, she's. But Del went to the mass wedding. She did? Uh huh. And she wanted me to take her and I refused to go and she got mad. Morelir? Well, I said I said I would not feel comfortable going. I was not invited."
470.48,490.16,SPEAKER_05," Mm-hmm. You know, and mom and dad were like, well, you know, a wedding that's a mass is open to everyone. I was like, that's fine. But I don't, I would not feel comfortable going. I think that would be obnoxious. And I think they would then feel guilty for not inviting me. Right, to the, you know, the other side. I just wouldn't go. So they had to take a Del and then drive her home."
491.12,497.76,SPEAKER_05," So it was kind of pissy at me. Mm-hmm. That's okay. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I've been thinking about it."
497.76,522.08,SPEAKER_03," And the black's not going to be so hot, you know, but yeah. Well, apparently they were also carrying lilies. Which is kind of goofy. Well, I guess you did that to someone suggested that to work and have a little lilies. Some both of Virgin Mary. White lilies? White lilies and black dresses."
522.08,529.92,SPEAKER_05," Oh, my goodness. That's funny. Yeah. And that was carrying on that she thought she was at a funeral"
529.92,543.28,SPEAKER_03," and should keep reminding herself. Mm-hmm. So now, did you, do you think, you think my wedding's for me pretty tasteful, right? Oh, yeah. Now, what about the matchbox? Well, I'll work on it."
544.56,548.56,SPEAKER_05," I still think about the matchbox. Yeah, I'll tell them. You'll think about that."
550.40,554.88,SPEAKER_03, I haven't forgotten those and they'll still be in this kind of one I come from for me to.
558.48,562.08,SPEAKER_05, Remind him of that little item. Yeah.
562.56,576.08,SPEAKER_05," Yeah, I was talking to my friend Heather from Wisconsin the other day. And she told me about, you know, her sister's wedding and had her sister's wedding. They provided champagne and beer."
576.96,582.32,SPEAKER_05," But if you wanted any other kind of drink, you had to pay for it. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's, that's"
582.32,587.36,SPEAKER_03," actually kind of common, but it's, oh, it is. It's pretty day-class day. Why kind of? I mean, of course,"
587.36,598.16,SPEAKER_05," I didn't say I think to her. Yeah. You know, I said, as far as I knew we weren't charging people. Yeah. No. Yeah, Dad's already, Dad and I went to buy the wine the other day."
599.20,606.64,SPEAKER_05, Because they were having a sale on the wine dad wanted. Are you talking to me? Of course I'm talking to you.
606.64,611.12,SPEAKER_03," I could hardly hear you. Oh, I thought you were talking to somebody else and like put the phone down or something."
611.12,614.88,SPEAKER_03," I'm talking to you. Oh, yeah, no dad told me that. Oh, he did. It's all July in."
615.76,620.88,SPEAKER_05," Yeah. Yeah. Well, not crashed or well, not creek or something like that. I don't know."
623.04,629.04,SPEAKER_05," There's a pretty good sale. So, um, I'm always to keep our eyes open for our champagne sale."
629.04,634.72,SPEAKER_05," Do you know if dad called Spencer yet? I told him this morning to do it this, this week. Uh-huh."
634.72,641.28,SPEAKER_05, And he kind of keeps keeps forgetting. Yeah. How's he doing? Much better. Yeah. Yeah.
642.16,647.60,SPEAKER_05," He's off. He's off with chipper. He went to the loft this morning at 517. Oh, my god."
649.04,662.80,SPEAKER_05," It's like if he's not sleeping and it's because he couldn't breathe because all the cats were in the bedroom. So I think it's time to give all the cats a bath. Yeah, and you should do that. I know. It's a two person job though. I have to get somebody to help me. Oh, yeah."
662.80,672.80,SPEAKER_05, Yeah. He's free. Mm-hmm. I heard the car like start up at 517.
675.28,680.00,SPEAKER_03, But he seems happy and yeah. That's good. He really does.
681.52,688.64,SPEAKER_03," So, what are you sending me invitations out there? Well, they have to be out by July 15th."
689.60,694.00,SPEAKER_03, Mm-kay. So this week. Mm-kay. Yeah.
695.52,700.00,SPEAKER_05," Were you able to get Morgan's address? Well, I called his mother in twice."
700.00,703.52,SPEAKER_05, Mm-hmm. Both times I got the answering machine. I didn't quite feel come through a leaving a message.
703.52,705.92,SPEAKER_03," So I hung up. Oh, yeah. That might be on my case."
706.88,710.56,SPEAKER_03, Try it. Try it a little bit. Because I think she worked in the evenings. Okay.
710.56,712.64,SPEAKER_03, I could throw around 10 or something. Yeah.
713.60,716.56,SPEAKER_05, I figured it would be a fairly awkward message so I didn't bother.
716.56,719.52,SPEAKER_03, I know. Two now. I'm a trick-to-all. I'm a trick-spline. Yeah.
721.36,726.40,SPEAKER_05," But some get a little package together for you and Charlie. Oh, you are."
726.40,729.84,SPEAKER_05, A different one from the invitation package. Okay.
729.84,732.80,SPEAKER_05, Dad said there could be no Oreos in the invitation package.
735.28,740.80,SPEAKER_03," Actually, I bought something like two days ago to put in a package to the family there. Oh, boy."
741.68,746.08,SPEAKER_05, Yeah. You just had to tell a little postcard or something. Yeah. Yeah. I know.
747.12,750.72,SPEAKER_03," Just believe it or not. I mean, I feel like I've been kind of busy. Yeah."
751.36,768.56,SPEAKER_03," Oh, yeah. And you can tell I convinced the British Library to let me use the library without a letter of introduction which you generally need. Uh-huh. So I have my little ID card to go there, which is very exciting. I'm going there tomorrow. That's wonderful. Yeah."
768.56,774.96,SPEAKER_03, But I had to explain and kind of great to tell what my research was. Yeah. Yeah.
776.24,780.56,SPEAKER_03," Well, that's good. That'll give you something to do. Yeah."
782.40,796.32,SPEAKER_03," But every time I go up to that view, I go off to look at like part-time jobs and stuff. They're just so crappy. I mean, it's like literally chamber-made jobs for like four, 25 and hours."
798.56,806.00,SPEAKER_03," I mean, really, yucky. So I'm kind of depressed about that. Sure."
807.20,827.76,SPEAKER_03," I mean, it's, well, I mean, it's, you know, it's, you know, means to an end to like whole program or whatever for me. But it's like, if I'd known in advance, it's the only jobs I could get would be like bartending. Well, we hear bartending. It's even bartending because no one gets an extreme family. It's better or a or beer."
828.00,831.20,SPEAKER_03, Yeah. There's three out there. And they're all on tap.
835.68,841.12,SPEAKER_03," How's Jerome? Oh, he's good. We got him a bigger aquarium thing. Uh-huh."
841.12,848.16,SPEAKER_03," Did he let him run around? Um, yes, last night he was running around in the bathroom."
848.16,872.24,SPEAKER_03," But two things I can't let him do during the day because, you know, we live over a sandwich champs by our landlord owns and works. And, um, he squeals when you let him out. I mean, really loud. Oh, my dear. He gets excited. Yeah, because he gets so hyper. But um, he's quite cute."
872.96,880.72,SPEAKER_03, My buddy is. Yeah. He pulled a little like kitchen towel into his cage and rants himself up in it.
881.68,887.84,SPEAKER_05," It's very cute. Do you let him like rest on your lap? Like, who you like sleep on your"
887.84,899.12,SPEAKER_03," anything? He doesn't sleep. He doesn't seem to sleep very much at all. But he does, you know, remain calm and stuff. Yeah."
899.20,901.12,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
902.24,907.04,SPEAKER_05," Yesterday, I too was so funny. Um, Sam cut down the peach tree for dad."
908.72,911.28,SPEAKER_05, What? What? What's peach tree?
912.40,926.00,SPEAKER_05," Oh, wait. There's like, you know up on the hill. Yeah. You know, the bowl ankle. Yeah. There's like, a lot of overgrowth. Yeah. Well, dad wanted the peach tree taken down. Oh, my goodness."
926.80,941.04,SPEAKER_05," So Sam took the peach tree out. But then from the next tree over, it's he was sat there and watched and he was like totally into it. And like, you know, at the at the big moment when the branches would fall at say, I would like chatter his teeth and excitement."
943.92,950.40,SPEAKER_03," With Sam using a, um, chainsaw chainsaw. Oh, my goodness. It was pretty funny."
951.92,955.20,SPEAKER_05," At first, I didn't even realize he was there. Then was I realized."
955.36,958.80,SPEAKER_03, Have you been to your friend Sam's house with the Cadillac on the rotating?
959.52,962.80,SPEAKER_05, Yeah. Yeah. I haven't seen the rotisserie yet.
963.84,967.92,SPEAKER_05," But it's a, it's a monstrosity of a house. Really?"
967.92,968.88,SPEAKER_03, Really?
970.08,973.28,SPEAKER_05," He lives all like non-ary, right? Yeah. Off of gallon lane."
974.08,980.24,SPEAKER_05," I don't know. Well, you know, like if you take Germtown Avenue all the way down, you know, that like floor shop on the left hand side."
980.88,983.84,SPEAKER_03, No. Is it past like the Burger King or?
983.92,985.92,SPEAKER_05," Oh, yeah. Right past there. Okay."
986.16,988.56,SPEAKER_05," Well, then the next light is gallon Avenue."
989.44,993.92,SPEAKER_05, And he lives off of gallon in this like monstrosity of a house.
994.56,997.60,SPEAKER_05," But like all the tons of rooms, but all the rooms are really small."
998.64,1001.92,SPEAKER_05, And like none of the rooms are open. Like they all have individual doors.
1002.64,1005.12,SPEAKER_05, You feel like really closed in. Yeah.
1005.12,1006.96,SPEAKER_03, So this just like monitor house.
1007.44,1007.68,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1008.64,1011.28,SPEAKER_05," Really even in the kitchen, there are like three different doors."
1011.68,1014.16,SPEAKER_05," You know, like to get to different parts of the house."
1014.16,1014.80,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1014.80,1016.40,SPEAKER_05, There are no open archways.
1016.40,1017.20,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1017.20,1018.40,SPEAKER_05, And then you crawl and run.
1019.60,1020.88,SPEAKER_03," They're just like, where I live?"
1022.16,1027.84,SPEAKER_03," A lot of doors, a lot of small rooms, all English houses or whatever, like that because you're in for the heating."
1027.84,1028.40,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1028.40,1030.24,SPEAKER_03, You only have to heat one room at a time.
1030.24,1031.76,SPEAKER_03, And I think there are idea of things.
1034.96,1038.48,SPEAKER_03, But the pain in the ass having to walk through these doors all the time.
1039.20,1042.96,SPEAKER_03, I thought with asking Charlie if he would take one of them down.
1043.68,1045.76,SPEAKER_03, The one from our hallway to our living room.
1047.44,1048.80,SPEAKER_05, It's probably unnecessary.
1049.52,1049.84,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1053.44,1053.68,SPEAKER_03, What?
1054.80,1055.44,SPEAKER_03, So what else?
1058.16,1059.20,SPEAKER_03, Have you seen Alicia?
1060.24,1061.44,SPEAKER_03," No, actually, I haven't."
1062.08,1064.64,SPEAKER_05, We and Marie and I went out with her probably like a month ago.
1065.52,1068.00,SPEAKER_05," And Alicia hasn't really, hasn't called me since."
1068.96,1069.84,SPEAKER_05, I haven't called her.
1071.12,1072.64,SPEAKER_05, So that's fine with me.
1076.00,1077.76,SPEAKER_05," You know, it doesn't really bother me."
1080.72,1082.96,SPEAKER_05, And Anne and Marie's kind of getting my nerves too.
1084.24,1085.68,SPEAKER_03, You're saying too much over her?
1085.68,1087.12,SPEAKER_05," Oh, dream."
1087.12,1088.32,SPEAKER_05, I don't see much over her.
1088.32,1088.72,SPEAKER_05, I don't know.
1088.72,1091.20,SPEAKER_05, Because she's been getting my nerves since the first day I got here.
1092.32,1095.60,SPEAKER_05, But she just always had all these stupid crises and I just can't deal with it.
1095.60,1096.96,SPEAKER_03, Like what kind of crisis?
1097.44,1099.52,SPEAKER_05, Like boys talking about her.
1099.52,1102.32,SPEAKER_05," Like, I mean, I'm, I'm, Anne Marie, you're 22 years old."
1103.04,1104.56,SPEAKER_03," What, boys at work?"
1104.56,1105.92,SPEAKER_05," No, I ship in Spargot."
1105.92,1107.52,SPEAKER_05, You're spreading rumors about her.
1108.08,1109.04,SPEAKER_05," And finally I said to her,"
1109.04,1110.80,SPEAKER_03," she doesn't go there anymore, does she?"
1110.80,1111.36,SPEAKER_05," Well, no."
1112.32,1113.12,SPEAKER_03, Okay.
1113.12,1115.12,SPEAKER_05, You know what I said? What are you doing?
1115.84,1121.52,SPEAKER_05," Where at age 22, your boys are still talking about how you are in bed."
1122.16,1124.00,SPEAKER_05, What kind of people are you hanging out with?
1124.64,1126.48,SPEAKER_05, What is the maturity level of these?
1127.36,1128.32,SPEAKER_03, I'm very inclined.
1128.32,1129.92,SPEAKER_03," And she just, I don't know."
1129.92,1130.72,SPEAKER_03, She got upset.
1132.32,1132.96,SPEAKER_05, Maybe.
1132.96,1134.88,SPEAKER_05, I think it was more of a reality check.
1135.60,1137.52,SPEAKER_05, Somebody needed to do it.
1138.56,1139.76,SPEAKER_03, How was her brother's wedding?
1140.56,1141.68,SPEAKER_05," Oh, wonderful."
1143.36,1145.44,SPEAKER_05, Everything with Peter's always wonderful.
1145.44,1145.68,SPEAKER_05, Wonderful.
1147.60,1149.20,SPEAKER_05," But again, we're a little jealous."
1149.92,1150.64,SPEAKER_01, All right.
1150.64,1151.20,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1151.20,1152.08,SPEAKER_05," You know, not sure."
1152.08,1153.76,SPEAKER_05, She doesn't have very much exciting news in her life.
1154.56,1155.60,SPEAKER_05, Did you get a job yet?
1156.56,1158.64,SPEAKER_05," Yeah, I think she starts tomorrow."
1158.64,1159.36,SPEAKER_05, Do you know what?
1159.36,1163.36,SPEAKER_05, I don't know if she's someone like activities coordinator at some hotel.
1164.32,1165.20,SPEAKER_05, I don't know what she does.
1167.36,1168.32,SPEAKER_05, I have to find out.
1169.20,1169.84,SPEAKER_05, For kids or?
1170.48,1170.80,SPEAKER_05, No.
1171.84,1174.88,SPEAKER_05," I mean, it's basically a hotel which kind of caters to conferences."
1175.68,1179.12,SPEAKER_05, And she would help with the running of the setup of those conferences.
1180.40,1181.52,SPEAKER_05, And that's my understanding.
1182.32,1184.00,SPEAKER_05, But I don't think she really knows what she's doing yet.
1184.00,1184.80,SPEAKER_05, That's funny.
1185.36,1185.76,SPEAKER_01, Mmm.
1185.76,1186.32,SPEAKER_03, Nice.
1190.80,1191.28,SPEAKER_03, Mmm.
1191.28,1192.88,SPEAKER_03, I'm trying to think of some cute things.
1192.88,1194.08,SPEAKER_03, Charlie did recently.
1194.64,1196.48,SPEAKER_03, It doesn't awful on a cute things.
1196.72,1197.52,SPEAKER_05, How does any do?
1199.76,1201.12,SPEAKER_03, I think she's actually pretty absent.
1201.12,1202.32,SPEAKER_03, My name is from Cisco.
1202.32,1202.64,SPEAKER_03, Right?
1203.28,1203.76,SPEAKER_04, He is.
1203.76,1204.72,SPEAKER_04, He is.
1204.72,1204.96,SPEAKER_03, He is.
1206.32,1206.88,SPEAKER_03, Today.
1207.68,1210.72,SPEAKER_03," Okay, he works near or on his way home from work."
1210.72,1212.32,SPEAKER_03, He passes his old apartment.
1212.96,1216.32,SPEAKER_03," And on his father's way home from work, his father goes by our new apartment."
1217.04,1221.60,SPEAKER_03," But he had to get his bike, which doesn't work."
1221.92,1228.16,SPEAKER_03, From the old apartment bike shed to his father was going to come and pick it up.
1228.16,1232.96,SPEAKER_03," So like his original plan was his father would come here, have a cup of tea."
1232.96,1239.20,SPEAKER_03," He would walk down to the old apartment, pick up the bike, bring it back here, and put it in his dad's car."
1240.00,1241.12,SPEAKER_03, Nice little Charlie.
1241.12,1248.08,SPEAKER_03," Why don't you just on your way home from work, pick up the bike, bring it here, and put it in the hallway downstairs."
1249.04,1250.96,SPEAKER_03," He's like, oh my god, you're right."
1251.44,1252.56,SPEAKER_03, That makes perfect sense.
1254.72,1258.64,SPEAKER_03," I mean, he was just going to walk by his old apartment and then walk back later."
1261.04,1262.56,SPEAKER_03, But he's awfully cute.
1262.56,1263.12,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1263.76,1264.08,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1264.88,1265.60,SPEAKER_05, That was good.
1266.00,1268.72,SPEAKER_03, We're going to see Jimmy Page and Robert plant.
1268.72,1269.52,SPEAKER_05, Oh yeah.
1269.52,1270.08,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1270.08,1271.12,SPEAKER_05, That's cool.
1272.08,1275.84,SPEAKER_03," Yeah, my friend, my only friend here who's actually not here anymore."
1275.84,1277.12,SPEAKER_03, He went to Hong Kong today.
1277.68,1279.52,SPEAKER_03, This guy lost what I knew from NYU.
1280.24,1285.28,SPEAKER_03, I saw him a couple weeks ago and then he didn't know he was going to Hong Kong and he had bought the tickets now.
1286.48,1288.64,SPEAKER_03, So he gave us three for the price of two.
1289.44,1294.64,SPEAKER_03, So we can sell the third probably for a whole lot of money to pay for all three of them.
1296.08,1296.72,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1297.92,1302.72,SPEAKER_03, So I'm looking for the one little light at the end of the time.
1305.12,1306.64,SPEAKER_03," I mean, I'm trying to, you know,"
1306.64,1308.00,SPEAKER_05, doesn't it Charlie and friends?
1309.28,1312.00,SPEAKER_03," He does, but he doesn't have a lot."
1312.64,1314.32,SPEAKER_05, Yeah. He like him.
1314.96,1316.56,SPEAKER_03," Yeah, I like most of them."
1316.56,1317.84,SPEAKER_03, There's one of them I don't like.
1318.88,1327.28,SPEAKER_03," But I mean, they're all, you know, everyone's so busy, you know, click they're all working people, you know, sure."
1329.28,1330.40,SPEAKER_03, And he's been so busy.
1330.40,1334.16,SPEAKER_03," I think the last so many months, the years have really socialized it all."
1334.16,1337.36,SPEAKER_03, So in a way he's kind of calling certain people kind of out of the blue.
1337.36,1347.28,SPEAKER_03," But it's been Lucy who I really, really like and invited us to go to this club that her like, I have some relational curves."
1347.28,1348.24,SPEAKER_03, It's like the DJ.
1349.04,1354.96,SPEAKER_03, That like one of these big like London kind of club things.
1354.96,1356.40,SPEAKER_03, So we're going to that this weekend.
1357.44,1358.56,SPEAKER_03, She gave us three passes.
1358.56,1359.36,SPEAKER_03, So that's cool.
1359.36,1363.92,SPEAKER_03, And we're going with her and her boyfriend who's a guild or actually.
1365.76,1367.20,SPEAKER_03, So the both really nice.
1367.20,1371.12,SPEAKER_03," I have like them, but most of all, and they're really outgoing and everything."
1374.88,1376.40,SPEAKER_05," Well, I was worried about you the other day."
1376.40,1378.88,SPEAKER_05, So I gave free phone calls to all your friends.
1378.88,1380.24,SPEAKER_01, But they didn't call me.
1380.24,1380.72,SPEAKER_05, I know.
1380.72,1383.60,SPEAKER_05," Well, that's because the pins aren't activated yet."
1384.72,1385.76,SPEAKER_01, One of the activated.
1386.40,1387.92,SPEAKER_05," Well, that's what tomorrow."
1387.92,1388.80,SPEAKER_01," Oh, okay."
1389.52,1394.16,SPEAKER_05," But yeah, because I called John Raulston to tell him to call you."
1394.16,1395.84,SPEAKER_05," And he wasn't there, but Joe was there."
1396.80,1398.88,SPEAKER_05," Of course, I don't know Joe, but we started talking anyway."
1399.92,1402.56,SPEAKER_05," And I said, you know, he said, well, why don't I call him?"
1402.56,1404.32,SPEAKER_05," I said, I'll give you a free phone call."
1406.88,1411.20,SPEAKER_05," So he, John, and Sharon, I'll have paid numbers."
1415.44,1416.08,SPEAKER_03, That's good.
1416.88,1417.92,SPEAKER_03, I'm kind of need one.
1417.92,1420.08,SPEAKER_03," If you give one to Jolie, that would kind of be cool."
1420.08,1422.64,SPEAKER_03, Because I'd like to hear about the supportment burning down business.
1425.68,1427.60,SPEAKER_03," You know, I could do that."
1430.40,1431.28,SPEAKER_05, And I could do.
1431.92,1432.80,SPEAKER_05," Oh, my gosh."
1432.80,1434.40,SPEAKER_05, I went to Circuit City.
1434.40,1434.88,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1434.88,1437.44,SPEAKER_05," You know, to try, I was thinking about investing in a car phone."
1438.24,1442.40,SPEAKER_05," And you know, Circuit City sells their like tapes and CDs really inexpensively."
1443.36,1447.28,SPEAKER_05," So I got Michael Jackson, off the wall."
1448.56,1449.68,SPEAKER_05, 595.
1449.68,1450.48,SPEAKER_01, Wow.
1450.72,1453.84,SPEAKER_05, I got best of a lover boy.
1454.24,1454.96,SPEAKER_03," Oh, my God."
1454.96,1456.32,SPEAKER_05, 545.
1456.32,1457.28,SPEAKER_03," Oh, my God."
1457.84,1461.12,SPEAKER_03," You know, I used to have like this retro thing for lover boy."
1461.84,1466.72,SPEAKER_05, And then I got the greatest hits of salt and pepper for $6.
1466.72,1467.44,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1467.44,1468.24,SPEAKER_05, It was amazing.
1469.44,1470.32,SPEAKER_05, It's absolutely amazing.
1471.04,1472.72,SPEAKER_05, So I'm making a new already half that.
1473.52,1474.48,SPEAKER_05," No, this is a new one."
1475.04,1475.92,SPEAKER_05, It's different.
1475.92,1477.04,SPEAKER_05, I have greatest hits.
1477.04,1478.08,SPEAKER_05, This is best of.
1478.64,1479.04,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
1479.68,1481.84,SPEAKER_05, It's called Best of the Hits remixed.
1484.08,1484.56,SPEAKER_01, Wow.
1484.56,1485.44,SPEAKER_05, This is very exciting.
1485.44,1487.28,SPEAKER_05, So I have music to listen to on the way to work.
1487.28,1487.76,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1488.40,1489.12,SPEAKER_05, Which is cool.
1489.68,1490.72,SPEAKER_05, But I don't know.
1490.72,1493.44,SPEAKER_05," Michael, my whole Michael Jackson thing is just going crazy here."
1494.64,1496.08,SPEAKER_05, Ever since he did that interview.
1497.36,1497.76,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1497.76,1500.56,SPEAKER_05," Oh, and I didn't, I don't think I told you the big controversy."
1500.56,1503.84,SPEAKER_05," You know, Michael Jackson did this song."
1503.84,1505.36,SPEAKER_05, I forget what the song is called.
1506.08,1508.88,SPEAKER_05," But the words, some of the words."
1508.88,1510.56,SPEAKER_03," Oh, it's like anti-Semitic."
1510.56,1511.04,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1511.04,1511.44,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1511.44,1512.72,SPEAKER_03, Now that I heard about it.
1512.72,1514.32,SPEAKER_05, And would you know what it says?
1514.32,1514.80,SPEAKER_03, No.
1514.80,1515.36,SPEAKER_05, Okay.
1515.36,1516.32,SPEAKER_03," She's like, do me."
1516.32,1516.96,SPEAKER_03, Do me.
1516.96,1517.76,SPEAKER_05, It says.
1517.84,1518.88,SPEAKER_03," Jacob, I'll go boom."
1518.88,1519.12,SPEAKER_03, Man.
1521.20,1523.04,SPEAKER_05," It says, do me, do me."
1523.04,1524.24,SPEAKER_05," Take me, kike me."
1525.20,1525.84,SPEAKER_01, Oh.
1525.84,1529.52,SPEAKER_05, Now Michael Jackson claims that he never knew that kike was an offensive word.
1530.48,1531.60,SPEAKER_05, And that he just made it.
1531.60,1533.52,SPEAKER_05, It came to him one night while he was sleeping.
1533.92,1536.16,SPEAKER_05," Oh, so Hillary."
1536.16,1538.40,SPEAKER_03," Alex, like the sound keeps going out."
1538.40,1538.80,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1539.36,1539.68,SPEAKER_03, There.
1539.68,1540.64,SPEAKER_03, Now I can hear you again.
1541.76,1542.16,SPEAKER_03, Okay.
1542.80,1548.48,SPEAKER_05, So Michael Jackson agreed to redo the song.
1549.28,1549.84,SPEAKER_05, Okay.
1550.00,1556.56,SPEAKER_05," But they released 100,000 of the old CDs with the anti-Semitic lyrics."
1557.28,1557.76,SPEAKER_03," Oh, my God."
1557.76,1558.80,SPEAKER_03," Janie, how much does things worth?"
1558.80,1559.44,SPEAKER_03, Did you buy it?
1559.44,1560.40,SPEAKER_05, I'm trying to.
1560.64,1561.20,SPEAKER_03, Okay.
1561.20,1564.48,SPEAKER_05, I'm trying to find one because it's present.
1564.48,1569.36,SPEAKER_05," If you have one today and want to sell it today, it's worth $100."
1570.08,1572.80,SPEAKER_05, You have any idea how much that's going to be worth in five years.
1572.80,1573.44,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1573.44,1574.88,SPEAKER_05, I have to get my hands on one.
1577.04,1578.48,SPEAKER_03," Finally, Daniel, we're still alive."
1578.48,1582.24,SPEAKER_03, I'm sure he'd have one because I'm sure Sven was one of the recipients of those.
1582.24,1583.20,SPEAKER_05," Oh, I bet he was."
1584.72,1586.72,SPEAKER_05," But, oh, it's crazy."
1587.52,1588.40,SPEAKER_05, But you believe that?
1588.40,1589.76,SPEAKER_05," Oh, I didn't know it was offensive."
1592.48,1593.28,SPEAKER_05, He's a freak.
1593.28,1593.76,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1593.76,1594.32,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1594.96,1596.16,SPEAKER_05, He is such a freak.
1596.16,1596.96,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1597.04,1601.28,SPEAKER_05," And ever since that interview, like everyone quotes Lisa Marie Presley at work,"
1602.80,1609.68,SPEAKER_03," she said she was so dumb in that interview. I mean, the bit that I saw, yeah, they've pre-played it here like twice already, I think."
1610.40,1614.72,SPEAKER_03," But I just saw it for, I just saw like maybe the last 10 minutes, but she's such an idiot."
1614.72,1615.20,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1615.20,1618.00,SPEAKER_03, It's truly unbelievable how stupid she is.
1618.00,1618.32,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1619.20,1622.88,SPEAKER_03," Well, now, did you see the part where her father really wasn't that bright either."
1622.88,1623.92,SPEAKER_05, I don't think so.
1624.32,1625.28,SPEAKER_03," Anyway, okay."
1625.28,1639.60,SPEAKER_05," But did you see the part where Jane Polly or Diane Sawyer, whoever she was, says, what do you say to your fans and the audience members who think that you and Michael don't have a true relationship and you don't even sleep in the same bed?"
1640.24,1644.48,SPEAKER_05," And all of a sudden, at least in Marie goes, I tell them to eat me."
1646.56,1647.36,SPEAKER_03, She said that.
1648.88,1649.84,SPEAKER_03, Oh my goodness.
1650.32,1654.48,SPEAKER_03," So she didn't, she didn't inherit her mother's sophistication, huh?"
1654.48,1655.04,SPEAKER_03, No.
1656.56,1658.40,SPEAKER_05, So now we do that at work online.
1664.48,1665.84,SPEAKER_03, But she's priceless.
1667.04,1672.88,SPEAKER_03," God, those care kids are going to be the most like demented, weirdos, nasty, horrible kids."
1673.68,1675.04,SPEAKER_05," Oh my God, Hillary."
1675.04,1681.68,SPEAKER_05," Yesterday, I turned on Wimbledon and it was the the round before the quarterfinals."
1682.56,1683.92,SPEAKER_05, I'll fall the round of 16 I think.
1684.72,1689.60,SPEAKER_05," And it was Gabriella Sabatini, remember how he plays Lisa Raymond."
1691.12,1693.68,SPEAKER_05, I graduated from high school with Lisa Raymond.
1693.68,1694.88,SPEAKER_05, You can't know.
1696.48,1697.28,SPEAKER_05, Wow.
1697.28,1698.08,SPEAKER_05, There's a one.
1698.80,1700.16,SPEAKER_05, Gabriella Sabatini.
1700.16,1701.20,SPEAKER_03, What's her butt?
1701.20,1707.12,SPEAKER_05," But apparently, Lisa Raymond is like the top ranked US player for two years in a row."
1708.24,1708.56,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1709.28,1710.24,SPEAKER_03, Wait a minute.
1710.24,1711.28,SPEAKER_03, I think I remember.
1711.28,1712.56,SPEAKER_03, Was she blonde?
1712.56,1712.88,SPEAKER_05, Yes.
1714.24,1715.52,SPEAKER_05, She's kind of ugly and dumb.
1716.32,1717.60,SPEAKER_05, She has a twitching problem.
1718.24,1722.32,SPEAKER_03," Is she on the, um, were she on the tennis team with me?"
1723.60,1724.64,SPEAKER_05, I don't know.
1724.64,1727.52,SPEAKER_03, There was this girl who was really like a good tennis player.
1727.52,1730.72,SPEAKER_03," Like she was nationally ranked, ranked pretty high and stuff."
1730.72,1731.60,SPEAKER_03, Who was on that?
1731.60,1734.88,SPEAKER_05," Well, there was that ditzy blonde who was really good on your team."
1735.84,1736.16,SPEAKER_05, Hmm.
1736.16,1737.44,SPEAKER_05, Was a two years ahead of me.
1738.16,1741.84,SPEAKER_05," I don't, I don't think Lisa Raymond came to Notre Dame when you were still there."
1742.64,1743.28,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
1743.28,1746.24,SPEAKER_05," I think she, um, came in like sophomore year or something."
1747.12,1749.12,SPEAKER_05, But it was crazy to see her on TV.
1749.12,1750.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1750.00,1753.20,SPEAKER_05, And to hear Chris Edward Lloyd talking about Notre Dame.
1754.24,1754.64,SPEAKER_03, Really?
1754.64,1756.16,SPEAKER_03, She said something about Notre Dame.
1756.16,1756.88,SPEAKER_05, How will they talk?
1756.88,1758.48,SPEAKER_05," Well, she's saying anything about it."
1759.20,1763.12,SPEAKER_05," They said where she lives now, where she's from held."
1763.12,1766.00,SPEAKER_05," She wasn't start playing tennis, you know, like the background info."
1767.04,1770.88,SPEAKER_05," And they mentioned that, you know, she went to high school and Villanova, Pennsylvania."
1771.92,1772.88,SPEAKER_05, It was very exciting.
1773.76,1775.68,SPEAKER_05, And I just randomly turned it on.
1775.68,1776.48,SPEAKER_05, Wow.
1776.48,1777.20,SPEAKER_05, So I taped it.
1779.76,1782.00,SPEAKER_03, Really good looking forward to fanning.
1782.00,1783.12,SPEAKER_04, All I do is tape things.
1784.08,1784.88,SPEAKER_04, Oh my God.
1785.84,1786.64,SPEAKER_03, What?
1786.64,1788.48,SPEAKER_04, The second is died.
1788.48,1789.12,SPEAKER_03, What?
