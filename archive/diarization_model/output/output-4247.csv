0.00,2.00,SPEAKER_00, You didn't hang up.
2.00,4.00,SPEAKER_00, So you're staying up now.
4.00,6.00,SPEAKER_03, Don't do it.
6.00,7.00,SPEAKER_03, Don't do it.
7.00,8.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
8.00,12.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, we have to make a 30 minute phone call, believe it or not."
12.00,17.00,SPEAKER_00, So how are things there and how did the film festival go?
17.00,18.00,SPEAKER_00, Where is it still going on?
18.00,19.00,SPEAKER_02, That's so bad.
19.00,20.00,SPEAKER_02, But just tell me.
20.00,23.00,SPEAKER_02, Is this project like are you going to analyze my grandma or something?
23.00,25.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, here's what it is."
25.00,27.00,SPEAKER_00, It's a project of the University of Pennsylvania.
27.00,33.00,SPEAKER_00, It's a linguistics project and they're getting samples of people in a number of different languages.
33.00,42.00,SPEAKER_00, And basically they take a five minute segment and they analyze it for grammatical structures and linguistics.
42.00,43.00,SPEAKER_00," This, that and the other."
43.00,48.00,SPEAKER_00," And of course, if we don't give away any national secrets, I don't think there's any reason to worry about it."
48.00,50.00,SPEAKER_02, I just wanted it when it was.
50.00,52.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, I mean, that's my understanding."
52.00,57.00,SPEAKER_00, That's just a matter of kind of a great way to have a free phone call.
57.00,63.00,SPEAKER_00," Not that you've been sitting around waiting for, you know, to get a free phone call, but I just thought it would be fun."
63.00,68.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, if like I could make a free phone call to America, that would work out better."
68.00,86.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, actually to my knowledge, they're only going, they only do this from the US to, you know, to your, I mean, from the US and outward, as far as I know, they don't do the other direction, but we could find out."
86.00,90.00,SPEAKER_00," And if it turns out that it does, then we could have them contact you."
90.00,91.00,SPEAKER_00, How does that sound?
91.00,94.00,SPEAKER_02," I just thought of kidding, but that's okay."
94.00,102.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, you know, I think that somebody else asked that and I think that, first of all, they want a native speaker."
102.00,111.00,SPEAKER_00," And see, I can call my brother in New York as one of my two, I get two opportunities to make a 30-minute phone call."
111.00,114.00,SPEAKER_00, One is overseas and the other is to my brother.
114.00,115.00,SPEAKER_00, And that's it.
115.00,125.00,SPEAKER_00," And in your case, unless you had another native speaker that was long distance from you that was over there, this might be the only opportunity."
125.00,126.00,SPEAKER_00, You know what I'm saying?
126.00,127.00,SPEAKER_00," Right, right."
127.00,129.00,SPEAKER_00, Sorry about that.
129.00,131.00,SPEAKER_00, Isn't it maybe us?
131.00,134.00,SPEAKER_00, Is it really 11pm over there?
134.00,135.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
135.00,138.00,SPEAKER_02," Wow, it's like 11 or four or so."
138.00,140.00,SPEAKER_00," Right, I understand."
140.00,142.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, great."
142.00,144.00,SPEAKER_00, What should we talk about?
144.00,147.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, I don't know, tell me what's going on in America."
147.00,149.00,SPEAKER_02, I haven't seen the news in Egypt.
149.00,150.00,SPEAKER_00, Really?
150.00,153.00,SPEAKER_02," You didn't American, but I know it's going on in Russia, but."
153.00,154.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
154.00,155.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, let's see."
155.00,156.00,SPEAKER_00, What's going on?
156.00,159.00,SPEAKER_00, You want to just give you some headlines?
159.00,161.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, give me some headlines."
161.00,162.00,SPEAKER_02, What's going on up to?
162.00,169.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, I was just going to say Clinton just came out yesterday with his statement concerning affirmative action."
169.00,170.00,SPEAKER_03, Uh-huh.
170.00,182.00,SPEAKER_00," And basically, he has in the past said that he was not in favor of, you know, of making a allowance is strictly based on race."
182.00,207.00,SPEAKER_00," But at the same time, the analysis and the news show we say the conservative analysis and the news is that Clinton just came out and said that he doesn't believe in quota systems and in reverse discrimination, but that he does believe that affirmative action is necessary to move, you know, black Americans forward and to give them the opportunities that they've been denied."
207.00,211.00,SPEAKER_00," So he's trying to kind of walking a tight rope, you know what I'm saying?"
211.00,212.00,SPEAKER_02, Right.
212.00,214.00,SPEAKER_02," In other words, trying to please everybody."
214.00,217.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, let's see if we can make everybody happy."
217.00,219.00,SPEAKER_02, I think that he...
219.00,221.00,SPEAKER_02, I think it depends on making nobody happy.
221.00,222.00,SPEAKER_00, I think you're right.
222.00,228.00,SPEAKER_00," Because, you know, affirmative action is really under attack in the United States from many different quarters."
228.00,236.00,SPEAKER_00," And it's a big issue because it's supposed to be a gender, I mean, not a gender, a race color blind."
236.00,251.00,SPEAKER_00," And yet, it's like contractors that are bidding, you know, with a high bid or higher than the lowest bid are still getting the contracts only because they are a ethnic protected, you know, black or whatever."
251.00,257.00,SPEAKER_00," And it's really, you know, they're taking lawsuits to the Supreme Court and all of this, so it's..."
257.00,258.00,, Wow.
258.00,276.00,SPEAKER_00," Another thing that just came up was that the Supreme Court said that the redistricting of the congressional districts, one of which is in Georgia, violated the Constitution because it was based primarily on race."
276.00,277.00,SPEAKER_00, There was...
277.00,281.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, they were doing it because they were trying to make it for..."
281.00,284.00,SPEAKER_02, You're like they were trying to make it less segregated?
284.00,292.00,SPEAKER_00," They were trying to make the district majority black Americans, so therefore they drew it all the way across the state."
292.00,293.00,SPEAKER_00, You see what I'm saying?
293.00,294.00,SPEAKER_00," No, right."
294.00,309.00,SPEAKER_00," A very narrow district and it created a majority black district which then elected a black representative and then it was challenged because it said, well, the only reason that's been done this way is just to ensure that it was majority black."
309.00,311.00,SPEAKER_00, And that's not...
311.00,316.00,SPEAKER_00, You know.
316.00,318.00,SPEAKER_00, Hello?
318.00,319.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm here.
319.00,320.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
320.00,321.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm calling all this over.
321.00,322.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, I mean it's..."
322.00,337.00,SPEAKER_02," So, I did just think that today we had a discussion with students about, because we're doing a pre-departorial orientation, so we had our hot topics, discussions today where we break in small groups that we talked about, like political correctness, the racial prejudice, and such little rough, and some of it is them."
337.00,342.00,SPEAKER_02, It's just like different topics that they might encounter in America where they explore different attitudes here in Russia.
342.00,345.00,SPEAKER_02, So that was one of the things to kind of like that.
345.00,349.00,SPEAKER_02, But I have not really up on what the attitude is in America because I've been there so long.
349.00,359.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, there's a lot of frustration, I think, over the fact that there are a number of evidences that the affirmative action program is in fact discriminating in the other direction."
359.00,364.00,SPEAKER_00," And people are saying, wait a minute, why don't we just give everybody an..."
364.00,380.00,SPEAKER_00," Try to give everybody an equal shot, and if someone feels that they've been discriminated against because of their race, go at it from the standpoint of trying to remedy it through the courts, rather than saying that government has to give X number of contracts to minority no matter what."
380.00,381.00,SPEAKER_01, Right.
381.00,388.00,SPEAKER_00," And as a result, some people are getting contracts just because of the color of their skin."
388.00,390.00,SPEAKER_00, And you know what I'm saying?
390.00,392.00,SPEAKER_02, If they might not even be the most qualified.
392.00,395.00,SPEAKER_00, Either they're not even... they're not the low bid.
395.00,400.00,SPEAKER_00, Normally on contracts you take the low bid that meets the quality of specifications.
400.00,401.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
401.00,409.00,SPEAKER_00," But now there have been several cases where clearly, they didn't get it because they just didn't want the right color skin."
409.00,416.00,SPEAKER_00, So now is that really remedy the situation or is it just creating a lot of resentment?
416.00,417.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
417.00,418.00,SPEAKER_00, And it's kind of too bad for us.
418.00,419.00,SPEAKER_00, I don't want to mess.
419.00,420.00,SPEAKER_03," Oh, it's a mess."
420.00,423.00,SPEAKER_00," How long have you been there, by the way?"
423.00,424.00,, Over here.
424.00,427.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm at a big three years in November.
427.00,428.00,SPEAKER_00, Wow.
428.00,430.00,SPEAKER_00," So you really are out of touch, aren't you?"
430.00,434.00,SPEAKER_02, I like this thing I'm not totally out of touch.
434.00,435.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, I know what it's like."
435.00,438.00,SPEAKER_02, I've never very in touch even when I was still in America.
438.00,439.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, okay."
439.00,440.00,SPEAKER_00, You're that type.
440.00,441.00,SPEAKER_00, I got you.
441.00,444.00,SPEAKER_02, I was always doing my own world anyways.
444.00,450.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, I know what it's like because I'm having lived over in Korea for almost three years."
450.00,451.00,SPEAKER_00, It's...
451.00,456.00,SPEAKER_00," When you come back all of a sudden, the society has changed a little bit."
456.00,463.00,SPEAKER_00," New terminology, new buzzwords and all that stuff."
463.00,467.00,SPEAKER_00," Of course, when you get to be over 40 like me, you can miss that stuff just as a way."
467.00,468.00,SPEAKER_00, I don't know.
468.00,469.00,SPEAKER_00, I don't know.
469.00,470.00,SPEAKER_00," I think when you get older, you're more informed when I was in college."
470.00,471.00,SPEAKER_02, I didn't know what was going on.
471.00,472.00,SPEAKER_00, I was busy.
472.00,481.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, I'm thinking of, you know, like lingo that young people come up with, you know, young"
481.00,485.00,SPEAKER_00," gurus people. Yeah, I think I'm more informed now than I was in college."
485.00,488.00,SPEAKER_00, I was sort of out of it in college.
488.00,493.00,SPEAKER_00," But, by the way, did I tell you that I have a new job?"
493.00,496.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, in your email, you know, I'm not sure."
496.00,499.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, in your email, you said that you're going to start your new job."
499.00,501.00,SPEAKER_02," So, what you didn't say what your new job was."
501.00,502.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, okay."
502.00,517.00,SPEAKER_00," I resigned here last week, effective artist tense, and I'll be taking the job of the Director of English Language Program of a private university in Atlanta, a larger university."
517.00,519.00,SPEAKER_00," So, it's kind of a step up for me."
519.00,522.00,SPEAKER_00, It's a good call to Mercer University.
522.00,525.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, you'll have to send a material somewhere."
525.00,527.00,SPEAKER_00," Hey, now we're talking to you."
527.00,530.00,SPEAKER_00, You send people into EFL programs?
530.00,533.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, we get requests about it."
533.00,540.00,SPEAKER_02," I don't know how many people actually go because a lot of them don't have a lot of money, but we get students every year that ask about it and say they have money."
540.00,543.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, you can be able to come down and tell us whether or not they go."
543.00,552.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, well, you can be sure that we will send you information because, you know, I've got to go down there and we're trying to improve the program."
552.00,561.00,SPEAKER_00," So, you know, we're adding thousands of dollars of state-of-the-art language, you know, equipment, lab equipment, and all of that, and they're restructuring everything."
561.00,564.00,SPEAKER_00," So, that's what I'm supposed to do next."
564.00,567.00,SPEAKER_02, Does that have any scholarships for volunteers?
567.00,573.00,SPEAKER_00," I've never heard of a scholarship for an English language program personally, but I think-"
573.00,576.00,SPEAKER_02," I think I'm going to give it to you, but I keep thinking I'm going to find one of these days."
576.00,578.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, I know. I'm sure that they promise."
578.00,586.00,SPEAKER_00," You know, the question of whether they have scholarships for international students for the regular program is a good one, and I'd like to find out."
586.00,592.00,SPEAKER_00," I'd like to think that they do, and I think they might, but I don't know yet."
592.00,596.00,SPEAKER_00," It's not going to be my particular area of expertise, you know."
596.00,600.00,SPEAKER_00," That's going to be a regular program, but still, I would like to know."
600.00,602.00,SPEAKER_00, I can tell people like-
602.00,605.00,SPEAKER_02," So, are you looking for a new job or did they just like come to you?"
605.00,616.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, I was looking for a new job, and I've been looking for about a year and a half, and when I went to NASA in New Orleans, you know, the one that you missed."
616.00,619.00,SPEAKER_02," I know, I was on the ground when there was so much fun."
619.00,624.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, it was a blast, but I'm not sure it was more fun than Miami, I mean, you know."
624.00,626.00,SPEAKER_00, But it was fun though.
626.00,633.00,SPEAKER_00," You would have enjoyed it, and as I said to you in the email, the Russians and the Siberians and all of these people were just hilarious."
633.00,637.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, we had a nice little visit, we really did."
637.00,638.00,SPEAKER_00, Too bad I did.
638.00,640.00,SPEAKER_02, I can't believe they were calling for a lobby.
640.00,643.00,SPEAKER_02, We were in it to hear that she was calling herself a lobby.
643.00,644.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, really?"
644.00,645.00,SPEAKER_00, You didn't know that.
645.00,649.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, can't say that because in Russian it's just, you know, too far, but it's just a Russian scene."
649.00,655.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, you would think of crayons saying anything, but the thought of people calling her a lobby in America is so far."
655.00,657.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, that's what you said."
657.00,658.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, I didn't know it."
658.00,661.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, then it's so hard to do that."
661.00,663.00,SPEAKER_02, But I just think it's hysterical.
663.00,669.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, you should have seen them dancing around with the crowd out there when they had this Caribbean band or something."
669.00,672.00,SPEAKER_00, It was kind of interesting.
672.00,677.00,SPEAKER_00," But yeah, we went on a shrimp boat tour also."
677.00,680.00,SPEAKER_00, It was kind of fun.
680.00,684.00,SPEAKER_00," You know, you've got to sort of do that kind of weird stuff."
684.00,689.00,SPEAKER_00, I interviewed for this job at Naptha.
689.00,698.00,SPEAKER_00," So that's kind of how it got to where it was, you know, that was a major, major point to reach."
698.00,701.00,SPEAKER_00, Do that interview and that was a good interview.
701.00,709.00,SPEAKER_00," So yeah, I kind of, I knew they were trying to expand their program and I said, well, if you're going to do that, call me because I would be interested in an opportunity."
709.00,711.00,SPEAKER_00," And so I've taken it, you know."
711.00,712.00,," Well, great."
712.00,714.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, I'm excited about it."
714.00,717.00,SPEAKER_02, What city were you and were you far from Atlanta?
717.00,725.00,SPEAKER_00," No, actually, Branao is located north of Atlanta about 50 miles north of the freeway."
725.00,730.00,SPEAKER_00," Which around here is, you know, not even considered to be that far."
730.00,737.00,SPEAKER_00," But this, and I don't even live in Gainesville, which is a city where this universe, where Branao is."
737.00,740.00,SPEAKER_00, I commute about 33 miles from the south west.
740.00,743.00,SPEAKER_00, It's a 45 minute ride.
743.00,745.00,SPEAKER_00, And I'll be commuting.
745.00,748.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, actually, maybe two or three miles closer."
748.00,750.00,SPEAKER_00, I'll be commuting down into Atlanta.
750.00,752.00,SPEAKER_00," See, I live north of Atlanta."
752.00,754.00,SPEAKER_00, So it's okay.
754.00,756.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, I'm excited about it."
756.00,759.00,SPEAKER_00, It's a 25% increase in salary.
759.00,760.00,SPEAKER_00, How about that?
760.00,761.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, that's good."
761.00,762.00,SPEAKER_02, I can deal with that.
762.00,763.00,SPEAKER_02, You can deal with that.
763.00,764.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
764.00,765.00,SPEAKER_00, So my job.
765.00,767.00,SPEAKER_02, I think I'm a little free for some raise every year.
767.00,768.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, yeah."
768.00,771.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, if I get 3% around here, you know, I was happy."
772.00,774.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, you're all about who I am."
774.00,776.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm glad you got that one.
776.00,777.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, really."
777.00,778.00,SPEAKER_00," You know, last year, I got 2%."
778.00,779.00,SPEAKER_00, I was really not happy.
779.00,784.00,SPEAKER_00," And maybe you should apply for this job here, Marianne."
784.00,786.00,SPEAKER_00, You need to come back in to from outer space.
786.00,788.00,SPEAKER_02, I don't know.
788.00,790.00,SPEAKER_00, I don't know.
790.00,791.00,SPEAKER_02, I don't know.
791.00,793.00,SPEAKER_02, I don't know if I can handle it in Georgia.
793.00,794.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, really?"
794.00,795.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, let me just..."
795.00,796.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, I don't know."
796.00,797.00,SPEAKER_02, I haven't lived in the south.
797.00,798.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
798.00,814.00,SPEAKER_00, I don't think anyone would understand me. I must speak to quickly.
814.00,816.00,SPEAKER_02," No, I don't think so."
816.00,819.00,SPEAKER_02," That's how my students, I'm from the EEC, won't understand it."
819.00,830.00,SPEAKER_02," I don't know if I'm going to understand it, but when I do lecture sometimes when I get into it and start getting excited, I forget and I stick really quickly and hope it's like, whoa, it's okay, I'm pleased because you have to be used to it."
830.00,834.00,SPEAKER_00, Where are you actually originally from?
834.00,838.00,SPEAKER_00," Pennsylvania. Oh, Pennsylvania, not from Pittsburgh."
838.00,843.00,SPEAKER_02," No, the other side is Atlanta. I see. Grand, I must say there."
843.00,850.00,SPEAKER_00, You're okay. You're okay. I'm okay. You don't like Pittsburgh?
850.00,854.00,SPEAKER_00," No, I'm saying that you're well, I'm not sure whether I like Pittsburgh or not."
854.00,858.00,SPEAKER_00, I've got a student that's transferring there to Duquesne.
858.00,864.00,SPEAKER_00, Uh-huh. But what I'm saying is your accent is not too severe.
864.00,870.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, some people are in that pretty bad accent. I've tried to avoid getting one."
870.00,876.00,SPEAKER_02," Just move it off. Just have a minute off. My little sister has very bad grandma, which is about."
876.00,880.00,SPEAKER_02," She doesn't want me to. She's like, if she was finished tight forces, they weren't just cool or anything."
880.00,886.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, and people with friends don't tend to speak correctly or well anyway, but then she's a black boyfriend."
886.00,892.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, I don't know what she's talking about. Oh, my goodness. You've got some dialect mixing up there."
892.00,898.00,SPEAKER_02, I know. It's very cute. You should do some to call her about her. That would have been interesting.
898.00,902.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, we've worked out either. Yes, native English speakers."
902.00,906.00,SPEAKER_02," I don't know. I'm not just a qualified. Oh, well."
906.00,912.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, you are doing primarily advising, right?"
912.00,918.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah. I mean, you talk to students about educational opportunities and do you help them make applications?"
918.00,924.00,SPEAKER_02," Um, I mean, we try and get them to do it themselves. Maybe, absolutely, they don't understand."
924.00,928.00,SPEAKER_02," Then we help them. I mean, they're students who would want us to balance."
928.00,931.00,SPEAKER_02," We'll help with them if we would feel it, but we don't do that."
931.00,933.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, right."
933.00,937.00,SPEAKER_02," So I have some with their essays like, we will take their, you know, the personal statements."
937.00,941.00,SPEAKER_02, It's like that trying to send advice. They don't write the way in the arts.
941.00,945.00,SPEAKER_02, Do over here at all. They're very kind of convoluted and a lot of incidents.
945.00,949.00,SPEAKER_02," You just like what's the point, you know, standing for signs of A and I, too."
949.00,955.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah. Well, it sounds like a lot of fun."
955.00,961.00,SPEAKER_02," It's cool because I don't really have, um, I mean, my supervisor is in DC and she does them."
961.00,978.00,SPEAKER_02," She kind of does not really up on what's going on and she has a lot of other programs that work kind of at least for in the program. So I can pretty much do whatever I want. And we have a lot of freedom to think of new programs or new ideas or activities and, you know, that's kind of neat. And I don't really like having a boss over me. So I'll get with two of them."
978.00,984.00,SPEAKER_00," Right. Well, I'll have some freedom, but I'm also going to have a lot more responsibility at the time."
984.00,990.00,SPEAKER_00, So it's going to be different. I'll have teachers that I'm going to be supervising and all that.
990.00,995.00,SPEAKER_00," So the first thing is to get the teachers on my side, you know."
995.00,997.00,SPEAKER_03, You want to.
997.00,999.00,SPEAKER_00," Because if they don't get on your own, everyone again, too."
999.00,1006.00,SPEAKER_00," Uh-uh. No, I've got to warn, you know, win them over and then try to, try to work with this."
1006.00,1011.00,SPEAKER_00," This could be very difficult, but I'm committed to it, you know."
1011.00,1014.00,SPEAKER_00, So it's going to be interesting. I think it's a great opportunity.
1014.00,1019.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, every now, what are you in the international office or what office or admissions or what office for you?"
1019.00,1023.00,SPEAKER_00, I've been running the international office.
1023.00,1025.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, forced student advising."
1025.00,1027.00,SPEAKER_02," This is a pretty big change, though."
1027.00,1043.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, I've been doing forced student advising. I've been teaching English as a second language and I've been was recruiting over in Asia, five different trips, five different years, and activities and logistical support and and immigration and all that kind of stuff for these students here."
1043.00,1045.00,SPEAKER_00," It's just about everything, you know."
1045.00,1053.00,SPEAKER_00," And over there, I will be doing only English as a second language administrative work, you know, getting the program running and making decisions about it."
1053.00,1063.00,SPEAKER_00," And, you know, and also I'll be involved with every aspect of it, but in an administrative rather than a teaching capacity."
1063.00,1068.00,SPEAKER_00," So, but I think it's going to be interesting and challenging enough to keep me busy."
1068.00,1074.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, I like interaction with students, but it doesn't necessarily have to be in the classroom all the time, you know."
1074.00,1079.00,SPEAKER_00," I'll still, I will still, you know, I'll still have interaction with students."
1079.00,1083.00,SPEAKER_00, I just won't have it quite in the same capacity.
1083.00,1087.00,SPEAKER_00," You know, they'll be bowing down to me now instead of asking me to do favors for them."
1087.00,1088.00,SPEAKER_00," No, I'm just kidding."
1088.00,1092.00,SPEAKER_02, But I want to ask you to say you were an English teacher too.
1092.00,1094.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, that makes a difference for them."
1094.00,1098.00,SPEAKER_02," We have a director who works, he works, he's just, you know, directing and everything."
1098.00,1099.00,SPEAKER_02, Exactly.
1099.00,1104.00,SPEAKER_00," And I'll probably, you know, go in and substitute everyone in a while in the classes."
1104.00,1108.00,SPEAKER_00, And that'll be fun for me.
1108.00,1110.00,SPEAKER_00," You know, I do everything."
1110.00,1117.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, not everything, but I'm saying I've been teaching at night at another place and tutoring, you know, to bring the students to the classroom."
1117.00,1127.00,SPEAKER_00," So it's just a matter of trying to, you know, keep it afloat and move ahead."
1127.00,1133.00,SPEAKER_00, Let me mention one other thing you asked about the headlines.
1133.00,1138.00,SPEAKER_00, Are you familiar with the OJ Simpson trial?
1138.00,1148.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, when I was talking to you and I heard a little about it, and before that, when I was talking in parts, I was always on duty, and before that, when I was talking to rest this time, they kept showing it."
1148.00,1151.00,SPEAKER_02," And before that, when I was talking to a child, were they were so happy."
1151.00,1152.00,SPEAKER_00, You were coming out?
1152.00,1154.00,SPEAKER_02, I know. I think it's been going on for years now.
1154.00,1156.00,SPEAKER_00, I know. You're pretty well traveled.
1156.00,1158.00,SPEAKER_02, But I haven't heard the latest in students too.
1158.00,1166.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, the only thing that's latest is the prosecution rests at their case, and now the defense is bringing us people up, you know?"
1166.00,1180.00,SPEAKER_00, And basically the main defense that they have is that they're trying to get people to believe that the police planted all of the evidence to frame OJ Simpson.
1180.00,1187.00,SPEAKER_02," I'm not saying that when I was talking about one that had to touch over whatever would have, whatever a name I said."
1187.00,1188.00,SPEAKER_02," Mark, for a moment."
1188.00,1191.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, I'm like, what? Why? What the police be doing is?"
1191.00,1194.00,SPEAKER_02," There's only a better thing for doing that, Angela, if I do."
1194.00,1203.00,SPEAKER_00," I know, and it's unbelievable. It's terribly incriminating the DNA evidence, the blood evidence on the wheel, the blood on the socks, the bloody glove, all that."
1203.00,1208.00,SPEAKER_00," It looks like, for all the world, that there's no other possibility. It really does."
1208.00,1221.00,SPEAKER_00," But see, this is another race thing, because they've done polls that show that 70-something percent, like about 78 percent of whites believe that OJ is guilty."
1221.00,1226.00,SPEAKER_00, But only 68 percent of blacks believe he is innocent.
1226.00,1227.00,SPEAKER_03, Wow.
1227.00,1233.00,SPEAKER_00," And it's a matter of a distrust of the judicial system, I think, on the part of the African-Americans."
1233.00,1239.00,SPEAKER_00, And I think they have reasons for that. Some of those reasons are valid. Some of them may not be valid.
1239.00,1250.00,SPEAKER_00," It's not. This trial is not racist, but people just believe that if there's one juror that, for some reason, doesn't believe he's getting a fair shake, he's going to walk out."
1250.00,1253.00,SPEAKER_00," And he could be, in fact, guilty, you know what I'm saying?"
1253.00,1254.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
1254.00,1258.00,SPEAKER_00," So people have very disillusioned right now with the criminal justice system here, believe me."
1258.00,1263.00,SPEAKER_02," What's that happening is disgusting. They're making it like a big circus, and it's on TV all the time."
1263.00,1266.00,SPEAKER_02, And I don't think this is about any of it to be filmed.
1266.00,1269.00,SPEAKER_00," I think you're probably right, and it's too bad. What are we going to do?"
1269.00,1273.00,SPEAKER_00," We've got to have justice in this country, and we're just pitching."
1273.00,1276.00,SPEAKER_02," And it's embarrassing, like, oh, wow. No, because this is on TV."
1276.00,1279.00,SPEAKER_02," Everybody thinks it's ridiculous. See, and Ann was showing it."
1279.00,1281.00,SPEAKER_02," You can't see an hour at least, see about that."
1281.00,1285.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, are you kidding? See if Ann's going to be wearing the ass off-base."
1285.00,1287.00,SPEAKER_00, What's off-base?
1287.00,1289.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, well."
1289.00,1293.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, well. Let me mention one other thing. We don't have that much longer, believe it or not."
1293.00,1298.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah. See, 30 minutes gets fast when you're talking between residents."
1298.00,1301.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, you're supposed to say, in the email, oh, it's such a long time."
1301.00,1304.00,SPEAKER_02," I thought, I could talk to my parents for two hours, and I'd say, oh, I mean, to happen."
1304.00,1307.00,SPEAKER_02," I didn't like nothing to me. Yeah, but I'm not."
1307.00,1310.00,SPEAKER_02," And when you're overseas calling for happen hours, like a short phone call."
1310.00,1313.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, that's true, but it is late there, and I didn't want to keep you up too late."
1313.00,1316.00,SPEAKER_00," And after all, it's not like I'm your parent."
1316.00,1319.00,SPEAKER_00, You know? I may be open up to be your parents.
1319.00,1320.00,SPEAKER_00, It's true.
1320.00,1324.00,SPEAKER_00," I may be old enough to be your parent, but I'm not your parent."
1324.00,1326.00,SPEAKER_02, I don't think you're quite old enough.
1326.00,1330.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, well, I don't know. You just look a lot younger than you are. How about that?"
1330.00,1334.00,SPEAKER_00, You'll appreciate that later.
1334.00,1337.00,SPEAKER_02," Yes, but everyone keeps telling me. Yeah."
1337.00,1342.00,SPEAKER_00, The other trial that started last week is the one in South Carolina.
1342.00,1346.00,SPEAKER_00, You're at about that. See them Smith trial?
1346.00,1351.00,SPEAKER_00, The mother that roger car into the lake with her two little boys strapped into their safety seats.
1351.00,1355.00,SPEAKER_00," No, I didn't hear this at all. Oh, it's just, it's heartbreaking."
1355.00,1357.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, when did this happen?"
1357.00,1360.00,SPEAKER_00, Last October.
1360.00,1372.00,SPEAKER_00," And I could say, Lisa. Yeah, she, it was like this woman reported that her children had been her two little boys and this was like 14 months and nine months or something like that."
1372.00,1375.00,SPEAKER_00," Had been, they're very, very young."
1375.00,1389.00,SPEAKER_00," Okay. She reported that someone had car, jacked her car and taken her two sons away, and she made an appeal over two weeks, like about 10 days or two weeks, where she was saying, you know, please bring my babies back and all of this kind of stuff."
1389.00,1391.00,SPEAKER_00," And Pete, the whole nation was just shocked."
1391.00,1399.00,SPEAKER_00, What they were even more shocked when she finally admitted that she had pushed her car into the lake with him strapped into their car seats and drowned them.
1399.00,1412.00,SPEAKER_00," Why did she do that? Oh, just on the, well, the only reason that, you know, logical reason we can think is the fact that she was in a divorce with her first husband."
1412.00,1424.00,SPEAKER_00," And, and she was having an affair with another guy that she wanted to marry, but he had written her letter the day that she did this saying, I do not want children."
1424.00,1428.00,SPEAKER_00," Isn't that hideous? Oh, it's just horrible."
1428.00,1431.00,SPEAKER_01, Just horrible. I know.
1431.00,1442.00,SPEAKER_00, And the trial just started and the guys who dove in and found the car and everything were testifying that they saw a little hand pressed up against the window when they found the car.
1442.00,1447.00,SPEAKER_00, I know. I won't say anymore about it. It's just awful. It's terrible.
1447.00,1451.00,SPEAKER_00," And of course, people are saying, you know, okay, bring out the electric chairs."
1451.00,1458.00,SPEAKER_00," And, you know, and then other people are saying, well, this woman was obviously offer rocker and therefore she's not responsible."
1458.00,1462.00,SPEAKER_00," But, you know, that's another big argument. When are you responsible?"
1462.00,1466.00,SPEAKER_00," When do you not? So, when are you insane?"
1466.00,1474.00,SPEAKER_02," Unbelievable. So, I think they should just make her have a heartbreak for never ask if they can."
1474.00,1480.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, well, they were just saying, well, you know, which is worse. Of course, she's been depressed and suicidal since."
1480.00,1487.00,SPEAKER_00," And they said, well, the worst punishment is the maker sitting jail and rot for the rest of her life, thinking about, you know, what she did."
1487.00,1495.00,SPEAKER_00," And then the other people say, well, put her out of her misery, but, you know, it's just, I don't know."
1495.00,1503.00,SPEAKER_00," It's so horrible. I mean, because she represented to the nation that someone had kidnapped her children, you understand."
1503.00,1510.00,SPEAKER_00," So, it's that. And that's really big on the news, too. So, anyway."
1510.00,1514.00,SPEAKER_02," So, what else is that? Well, I know."
1514.00,1519.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, tell me what's exciting about your life right now."
1519.00,1522.00,SPEAKER_02, Because I didn't know how life is.
1522.00,1524.00,SPEAKER_00, Because they're going to cut through.
1524.00,1528.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, I went to the conference in Greece, the Osteocere of conference. That was pretty fun."
1528.00,1530.00,SPEAKER_02, Great. Can you happen?
1530.00,1532.00,SPEAKER_02, Great.
1532.00,1538.00,SPEAKER_02, I did the stop distance that great. I was very impressed. I thought it would be like this city itself was kind of like New York.
1538.00,1541.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, there's nothing. It's the psycholautics marshalism that it's polluted."
1541.00,1545.00,SPEAKER_02," And I mean, there's me ruins kind of here and there, but it's like surrounded by the fuzzy city."
1545.00,1549.00,SPEAKER_02, There's not even like any nice old architecture except for the ruins.
1549.00,1553.00,SPEAKER_02," You mean, great. Or town center is nice. There's like little wine, street shops."
1553.00,1556.00,SPEAKER_02, All the cafes are out stores. Right.
1556.00,1562.00,SPEAKER_02," But at the end, we had two extra days. So, we went to an island. We went to take a note. That was wonderful."
1562.00,1567.00,SPEAKER_02, I'll bet. And that's right. Where you should go for the case. You can put it at.
1567.00,1569.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, that's great."
1569.00,1571.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, you are coming to the Olympics here."
1571.00,1574.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm coming to the Olympics.
1574.00,1579.00,SPEAKER_00, I hope so. Yes. One year from yesterday.
1579.00,1581.00,SPEAKER_02, One year from yesterday.
1581.00,1584.00,SPEAKER_00, Right. They're celebrating like crazy down.
1584.00,1586.00,SPEAKER_02, It's not a hardy selling ticket.
1586.00,1590.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, yes. I ordered three tickets for my oldest daughters and myself."
1590.00,1593.00,SPEAKER_00," And we got to do one event, you know."
1593.00,1595.00,SPEAKER_00, Poor jump.
1595.00,1599.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, we wanted to get horse jumping because that's what they wanted."
1599.00,1604.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, you know, it's kind of historic. I forget we'll go to one event."
1604.00,1607.00,SPEAKER_02, You have to get land. They have to go to something.
1607.00,1612.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, right. But it'll be on the outskirts of Atlanta. I don't want to go down into the center."
1612.00,1613.00,SPEAKER_00, You know.
1613.00,1614.00,SPEAKER_02, Right.
1614.00,1615.00,SPEAKER_02, Traffic.
1615.00,1617.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, that'll be kind of crazy. Oh, yes."
1617.00,1621.00,SPEAKER_00, But some of the events are like $250 a ticket.
1621.00,1623.00,SPEAKER_02, I can invite some of them to the athletes.
1623.00,1624.00,SPEAKER_02, That's right.
1624.00,1626.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, yes. The finals, you know, and that kind of stuff."
1626.00,1631.00,SPEAKER_00," So no, we went for the cheap tickets, the horse jumping and the rowing and the archery and all that kind of stuff."
1631.00,1633.00,SPEAKER_01, Right. Right.
1633.00,1638.00,SPEAKER_00," But you ought to really think if you're in this area, you ought to come in and see something."
1638.00,1640.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, I forgot about it."
1640.00,1642.00,SPEAKER_00," Forget about the Olympics. Well, you mentioned green."
1642.00,1644.00,SPEAKER_00, But not in America.
1644.00,1648.00,SPEAKER_00, That's true. You mentioned grease and that's what made me think about it.
1648.00,1649.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, right. Yeah."
1649.00,1653.00,SPEAKER_00, Athens lives in competition with Atlanta and Atlanta one out.
1653.00,1655.00,SPEAKER_00," You know, this is the one."
1655.00,1658.00,SPEAKER_00, This is the 100th modern Olympics.
1658.00,1660.00,SPEAKER_02," Wow. Oh, yeah."
1660.00,1662.00,SPEAKER_02, But ask what do you want to say?
1662.00,1663.00,SPEAKER_00," Yes, they did."
1663.00,1665.00,SPEAKER_00, So we got it.
1665.00,1668.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, listen, I'm going to lose it in that for us."
1668.00,1670.00,SPEAKER_00, Too much pollution.
1670.00,1672.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, for the athletes."
1672.00,1674.00,SPEAKER_02," But then they had them in LA, so."
1674.00,1675.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, that's right."
1675.00,1677.00,SPEAKER_00, But I don't think they're going to...
1677.00,1679.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, they headed in Mexico City, didn't they?"
1679.00,1681.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, one year they did."
1681.00,1683.00,SPEAKER_02, So that was before I was born.
1683.00,1685.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, very polluted."
1685.00,1687.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, it is."

1751.00,1758.00,SPEAKER_00, We're waiting for a warning message saying the time is almost over and then we have to complete the conversation. Hang up and you go to bed and I go home.
1758.00,1759.00,SPEAKER_03, Right.
1759.00,1761.00,SPEAKER_00," Every 30, I don't go home yet."
