0.00,1.00,, Paul?
1.00,2.00,SPEAKER_00, Hello?
2.00,3.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
3.00,5.00,SPEAKER_00, We're... okay.
5.00,8.00,SPEAKER_00, It's not a really good connection.
8.00,11.00,SPEAKER_00, It's a sad light or something because there's a delay.
11.00,12.00,SPEAKER_00, Is there?
12.00,15.00,SPEAKER_01, It sounds like a k here for me.
15.00,17.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, I hear a delay."
17.00,20.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, maybe that's the recording."
20.00,22.00,," Yeah, I don't know."
22.00,27.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, it could be a delay if it is bouncing off the satellite that I do it."
28.00,31.00,SPEAKER_00," Anyway, you guys are coming to Europe."
31.00,32.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
32.00,35.00,SPEAKER_01, One second here.
35.00,39.00,SPEAKER_01, I'd essentially the date I don't remember right off the end.
39.00,42.00,SPEAKER_00," The 19th there, is that?"
42.00,45.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, it sounds about right."
45.00,48.00,SPEAKER_01, We're actually leaving next Monday.
48.00,53.00,SPEAKER_01, And we should be arriving in London.
53.00,58.00,SPEAKER_01, Joy.
58.00,62.00,SPEAKER_01, Great.
62.00,76.00,SPEAKER_01, I made the file that had all the information in it and now my computer doesn't want to open it.
76.00,79.00,SPEAKER_01, Oh.
79.00,81.00,SPEAKER_01, Modern... what is it?
81.00,85.00,SPEAKER_01, Wonders of modern technology or something like that.
85.00,87.00,SPEAKER_00, So you start school 1.
87.00,89.00,SPEAKER_00, When do you start with your...
89.00,92.00,SPEAKER_00, You're doing a PhD or a Masters first?
92.00,95.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, I'll be doing a..."
95.00,102.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm going to go for the Masters first and then hopefully transfer to a different school to get my PhD.
102.00,105.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm going to always use for the Masters.
105.00,113.00,SPEAKER_01, So I'd like to go to Cornell or Michigan or Wisconsin or E-Dub for my PhD.
113.00,116.00,SPEAKER_00, Someplace with a reputation?
116.00,117.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
117.00,119.00,, Exactly.
119.00,122.00,SPEAKER_01, So is the file opening or not?
122.00,124.00,SPEAKER_01," No, it's not."
124.00,130.00,SPEAKER_01," Actually, let me do something else."
130.00,136.00,SPEAKER_01, I can just look at all the email I sent you and that one's probably whatever I said was correct.
136.00,141.00,SPEAKER_01, If I said the 19th and that's probably what we're shooting for.
141.00,144.00,SPEAKER_00, What are you doing with that?
144.00,146.00,SPEAKER_00, How's this trip going to work?
146.00,153.00,SPEAKER_01," We're going to fly into London and then we'll be there for about two or three days, and then go after Ireland."
153.00,161.00,SPEAKER_01, And then we'll come back to London and then catch a ferry over to Oestanday.
161.00,163.00,SPEAKER_01," And then from there, just collect the Holland."
163.00,166.00,SPEAKER_01, So we're not going to stand Belgium at all.
166.00,169.00,SPEAKER_01, We're just going to straight up the Holland.
169.00,170.00,SPEAKER_01, So...
170.00,171.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
171.00,172.00,, Yeah.
172.00,174.00,SPEAKER_01," I'm sorry, God."
174.00,175.00,SPEAKER_00," No, it's okay."
175.00,178.00,SPEAKER_00," If I say anything, I can't hear you anymore."
178.00,181.00,SPEAKER_00, So it's a strange kind of phone call.
181.00,186.00,SPEAKER_00," It's like talking on a radio where you have to say over because, you know, anyway."
186.00,189.00,SPEAKER_01, I can hear everything you say even when I'm talking.
189.00,191.00,SPEAKER_01, I think.
191.00,198.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, maybe it doesn't interface well with the Dutch system that I don't know."
198.00,199.00,SPEAKER_01, Over.
199.00,202.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, over."
202.00,208.00,SPEAKER_01, So it looks like we'll be coming in on about the 19th.
208.00,209.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
209.00,212.00,SPEAKER_01, We're about to are you.
212.00,213.00,SPEAKER_01, You said you're not.
213.00,214.00,SPEAKER_01, You said you're not.
214.00,216.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, we're away from Amsterdam."
216.00,217.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
217.00,222.00,SPEAKER_00, The problem is we don't have a place to put you up.
222.00,224.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, that's going to be dope."
224.00,225.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
225.00,227.00,SPEAKER_00," But right, it's kind of..."
227.00,228.00,SPEAKER_00, We're kind of in transition.
228.00,231.00,SPEAKER_00, I'm living right now with Anya's parents.
231.00,238.00,SPEAKER_00, But we have a flat that we just got and we take possession of on this actually officially.
238.00,240.00,SPEAKER_00, We're renting it on the 16th.
240.00,243.00,SPEAKER_00, But Anya and our parents have been fixing it up.
243.00,247.00,SPEAKER_00," And that's just outside of you, Trif."
247.00,248.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
248.00,252.00,SPEAKER_00," Do you know, like, if you looked at a map, you know, or the place?"
252.00,257.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I think that's kind of like southeast of Amsterdam, correct?"
257.00,258.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
258.00,263.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, if you draw it, if you look at like Rotterdam is directly south of Amsterdam."
263.00,264.00,SPEAKER_00, Mm-hmm.
264.00,265.00,SPEAKER_00, And then...
265.00,271.00,SPEAKER_00, And Rotterdam's on the coast with the of the North Sea.
271.00,275.00,SPEAKER_00, Amsterdam is you go inland a little bit and north.
275.00,276.00,SPEAKER_00, And it's on the...
276.00,281.00,SPEAKER_00," It's on the coast of what they call the ISIL merits, an inland sea."
281.00,284.00,SPEAKER_00, And then Utrecht is a triangle.
284.00,287.00,SPEAKER_00, And it's sort of an isosceles triangle.
288.00,290.00,SPEAKER_00, So it's about even...
290.00,292.00,SPEAKER_01, It's about as Rotterdam.
294.00,297.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, it's like equal distance about an hour from Rotterdam."
297.00,299.00,SPEAKER_00, It's about an hour from Amsterdam.
299.00,301.00,SPEAKER_00, I see a little closer to Amsterdam.
301.00,304.00,SPEAKER_00," It's about 45 minutes to Amsterdam, or two Amsterdam."
304.00,307.00,SPEAKER_00," But yeah, what are your plans?"
307.00,310.00,SPEAKER_00, Are you going to be going into Amsterdam and staying somewhere?
310.00,311.00,SPEAKER_00, Or what are you going to do?
311.00,316.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, we'll probably just go in Amsterdam and stay unless you know the better place to stay."
316.00,319.00,SPEAKER_01, or something that you would think would be better.
319.00,325.00,SPEAKER_00," No, I mean, if you're looking for a place to stay, Amsterdam's probably the best place to go."
325.00,328.00,SPEAKER_00, And you can do the best.
328.00,329.00,SPEAKER_00, Sorry.
329.00,330.00,SPEAKER_00, Go ahead.
330.00,336.00,SPEAKER_01, We'll probably be there about two days and then we'll head off to Paris.
336.00,338.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, okay."
338.00,341.00,SPEAKER_00, So we plan to be in there for a little while to see you.
341.00,346.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, what is... I don't even know what day the 19th is and I don't have a calendar with me."
346.00,349.00,SPEAKER_00, Um...
349.00,353.00,SPEAKER_00, Let's see.
353.00,355.00,SPEAKER_01," Hold on, just back."
355.00,357.00,SPEAKER_01, Cam?
357.00,365.00,SPEAKER_01, Can you come out for a second place?
365.00,367.00,SPEAKER_01, It's a Wednesday.
367.00,368.00,SPEAKER_01," It's a Wednesday, okay."
368.00,373.00,SPEAKER_01, Do you have a map of Europe and that sheet that I planted up with our trip plan?
373.00,378.00,SPEAKER_01," Luckily, I've turned it out."
378.00,380.00,SPEAKER_01, I got this new version of Excel.
380.00,386.00,SPEAKER_01," Excel 5 and on the Mac, the creation kind of conflicts with something else I think."
386.00,392.00,SPEAKER_01, And so the computer thinks it's launching some other program and it punches all kinds of things that happen.
392.00,397.00,SPEAKER_01, Thanks.
397.00,398.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
398.00,401.00,SPEAKER_01," Okay, I see."
401.00,409.00,SPEAKER_01," I was going off by memory and yeah, this looks pretty much like what I thought it was."
409.00,414.00,SPEAKER_01, We are planning on coming in.
414.00,415.00,, Let's see.
415.00,419.00,SPEAKER_01," We're leaving Ireland Dublin on Monday, which is the 17th."
419.00,423.00,SPEAKER_01, And we're going to try to catch an all-night type thing where you hop in a bus and then arrive in London.
423.00,426.00,SPEAKER_01, The very next morning.
426.00,427.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
427.00,432.00,SPEAKER_01, And then we'll just try and catch.
432.00,435.00,SPEAKER_01, So we arrived Tuesday in London.
435.00,448.00,SPEAKER_01," Tuesday morning, we'll try and catch a train to the coast and then catch a ferry over to Austin Day and then come up into Amsterdam or Rotterdam."
448.00,451.00,SPEAKER_01, But either way.
451.00,456.00,SPEAKER_01, It was yeah.
456.00,458.00,SPEAKER_01," Rotterdam is Belgium, isn't it?"
458.00,459.00,SPEAKER_00, No.
459.00,460.00,SPEAKER_00," No, no, no."
460.00,462.00,SPEAKER_00, The Rotterdam is Holland.
462.00,463.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
463.00,464.00,SPEAKER_01, I'll wait.
464.00,465.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
465.00,466.00,SPEAKER_01, I'll wait.
466.00,473.00,SPEAKER_01," Looking at the ferry here, we might go up the coast from London and then catch a ferry from Hanwich to Rotterdam."
473.00,474.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
474.00,477.00,SPEAKER_00, What you want to do is hard to hook on Holland.
477.00,478.00,SPEAKER_00, That's how the ferries are.
478.00,481.00,SPEAKER_00, I've taken that ferry from London.
481.00,485.00,SPEAKER_00, And you can buy one ticket.
485.00,493.00,SPEAKER_00, And it's actually it covers the train expense from London all the way to hook on Holland.
493.00,495.00,SPEAKER_01, Is that very expensive?
495.00,499.00,SPEAKER_00," I can't remember how much I paid, but it's not outrageous."
499.00,502.00,SPEAKER_00," Like, like, I think maybe it was $100 or $150."
502.00,503.00,SPEAKER_01, For really?
503.00,504.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
504.00,507.00,SPEAKER_00," But it wasn't, I mean, yeah, something like that."
507.00,508.00,SPEAKER_00, It might have been $70.
508.00,509.00,SPEAKER_00, I can't remember.
509.00,510.00,SPEAKER_00, I did it.
510.00,515.00,SPEAKER_01," For $100, what's just take the channel, for $150."
515.00,518.00,SPEAKER_01, We can catch that all the way to Brussels.
518.00,523.00,SPEAKER_01, And then we've got a URL pass that we could take up into Holland.
523.00,524.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, then yeah."
524.00,530.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, you might want to check because of the URL pass you might be able to discount on the ferry too."
530.00,531.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
531.00,532.00,SPEAKER_01, We won't just forget it on the train.
532.00,536.00,SPEAKER_01, England's the only country over there that doesn't participate.
536.00,538.00,SPEAKER_00, They have a day of their own pass.
538.00,539.00,SPEAKER_00, They have a brick-out pass.
539.00,540.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, of course."
540.00,543.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, they don't consider themselves European."
543.00,544.00,SPEAKER_00, They're British.
544.00,546.00,SPEAKER_00, They're not European.
546.00,548.00,SPEAKER_00, There's Europe and there's Britain.
548.00,552.00,SPEAKER_00," And if you like, if you listen, they always make that distinction."
552.00,561.00,SPEAKER_00," They'll always say, if you ask a Brit, where is Europe, he won't point like down where he's standing, he'll point across the channel to like those other people."
561.00,565.00,SPEAKER_00, But I have to work.
565.00,567.00,SPEAKER_00, I'm working that whole week.
567.00,569.00,SPEAKER_00, I just started with this new job.
569.00,572.00,SPEAKER_00, But I can meet you in the evenings.
572.00,579.00,SPEAKER_00," On your will not be here, as you know, as you said, you know, if you hadn't met her before, there's a good chance she didn't really exist."
579.00,580.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
580.00,582.00,SPEAKER_01, And I spoke to her today and yesterday.
582.00,583.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
583.00,584.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, you've heard a voice."
584.00,588.00,SPEAKER_00," You still, you still, if you've never seen her that, yeah, I could be anchored by sister."
588.00,589.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
589.00,590.00,SPEAKER_01, But I heard her didn't you?
590.00,591.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
591.00,595.00,SPEAKER_01, Did you get that email I was saying yesterday?
595.00,596.00,SPEAKER_00," Yes, I did."
596.00,597.00,SPEAKER_00, Got it today.
597.00,602.00,SPEAKER_01," I was just trying to, I didn't call on you back just because I knew I'd have to call you back again."
602.00,607.00,SPEAKER_01," And I don't know how much the phone call is, but I imagine it's not cheap."
607.00,611.00,SPEAKER_00," But yeah, that's fine."
611.00,614.00,SPEAKER_00, So you'll be coming in the 19th.
614.00,616.00,SPEAKER_00, And you're looking at this.
616.00,630.00,SPEAKER_01," If we can, we might be coming in the evening of the 18th, but you know, who knows, maybe we were kind of planning a whole day to get from Ireland to Holland, but maybe it's only going to take us a half a day."
630.00,633.00,SPEAKER_01," And in which case, maybe if we come in early enough, we can give you a call."
633.00,637.00,SPEAKER_01," And then we'll leave for, for parents a day earlier or something."
637.00,642.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, we have a phone number at our new place, but we don't know it yet."
642.00,647.00,SPEAKER_00," So yeah, I mean, it is the Dutch phone system's a little, a little slow."
647.00,653.00,SPEAKER_00," So what we're going to do is, if you get it, if you get it,"
653.00,660.00,SPEAKER_01," you can just email it to me because I've, I've got my computer set up over here and I can check email and stuff."
660.00,666.00,SPEAKER_00," Okay, that's what I was going to say is hopefully I'm just going to call tomorrow and find out why our phone works."
666.00,668.00,SPEAKER_00, We didn't really expect it to work so soon.
668.00,673.00,SPEAKER_00," And if it's working because they've hooked it up and we have a number, then she's going to get the number."
673.00,682.00,SPEAKER_00," But if they say, well, it's hooked up because we didn't, we didn't disconnect it from the last people and it'll take us six months to get your phone and we'll just have to wait."
682.00,686.00,SPEAKER_00," But if we do have a phone number, oh, I don't know how long it takes."
686.00,689.00,SPEAKER_00," I'm just mocking, mocking the Dutch system."
689.00,693.00,SPEAKER_00," And I'm just not here to make, tell me to shut up."
693.00,695.00,SPEAKER_01, So you can get out of there.
695.00,696.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
696.00,707.00,SPEAKER_00," But Nick, will, you can always reach me at my in-laws house because for the most part, I come back here."
707.00,716.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, at least every other day, I will come back or at least every other day in July being as most of my closer here."
716.00,720.00,SPEAKER_00, Where do they live?
720.00,722.00,SPEAKER_00, A town called Briele.
722.00,725.00,SPEAKER_00, If you look at Rotterdam and then you go south-west.
725.00,726.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, okay."
726.00,727.00,SPEAKER_01, I see that.
727.00,735.00,SPEAKER_00," And yeah, it's a really small little town and it's real nice and has lots of history to it."
735.00,740.00,SPEAKER_00," Where we live, we live in a town called Nuhan that's just south of Utah."
740.00,741.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
741.00,742.00,, Okay.
742.00,745.00,SPEAKER_00, I don't know if that may not be on the map.
745.00,746.00,SPEAKER_00, I don't know.
746.00,754.00,SPEAKER_01," No, it's very, well, let's say, there was the entire continent of Europe in part of Asia."
754.00,755.00,, So.
755.00,758.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, new kind is actually bigger than Briele's."
758.00,761.00,SPEAKER_00," I thought Briele's on there, maybe new kind is too."
761.00,762.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, new kind of."
762.00,763.00,SPEAKER_01, It could be your pronunciation.
763.00,764.00,SPEAKER_01, I see a BREDA.
764.00,765.00,SPEAKER_01, Is that it?
765.00,766.00,SPEAKER_01," No, go."
766.00,767.00,SPEAKER_00, You have to go.
767.00,768.00,SPEAKER_00, We're by UTRAC.
768.00,771.00,SPEAKER_00, U-T-R-E-H-T.
771.00,772.00,SPEAKER_00, See that?
772.00,773.00,SPEAKER_00, Yes.
773.00,774.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
774.00,785.00,SPEAKER_00," If you go to just south of that real, very close, there's a canal just south of the, of the, of UTRAC where it is and then there should be a town on that called Nuhan."
785.00,787.00,SPEAKER_00, It would be Nuhagaine.
787.00,789.00,SPEAKER_01," No, that's not on there."
789.00,790.00,SPEAKER_00, No.
790.00,791.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
791.00,794.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, we live right, if you look at UTRAC, we live right there."
794.00,799.00,SPEAKER_00," And I have an auto, so that's not a problem."
799.00,800.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
800.00,809.00,SPEAKER_00," So if you guys are going to be, I'll have to figure out with, with, on your parents, you know, what I'll do maybe."
809.00,813.00,SPEAKER_00, I'll stay over here that night.
813.00,815.00,SPEAKER_00, And then I'll just come meet you guys.
815.00,819.00,SPEAKER_00," But you guys, are you guys going to come into hooking how you work?"
819.00,820.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
820.00,821.00,SPEAKER_00, Let me give you my work number.
821.00,823.00,SPEAKER_00, If I can find my work number.
823.00,824.00,SPEAKER_01, And do they speak German there?
824.00,830.00,SPEAKER_00," Because if they do, I can, they will, in my work, they'll speak English."
830.00,831.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, okay."
831.00,834.00,SPEAKER_00," If you, if you call work, they will speak English to you."
834.00,835.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
835.00,837.00,SPEAKER_00," You speak English to them, they'll speak English back."
837.00,838.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
838.00,846.00,SPEAKER_01," So they, I talked to your father in law and started speaking in English and he didn't understand me, but I kind of understood him just because Dutch is similar to German."
846.00,847.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
847.00,852.00,SPEAKER_00," No, my father in law doesn't speak English or German."
852.00,859.00,SPEAKER_01, But German sounds like English or like Dutch that he probably could have understood me and I could have understood him.
859.00,860.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
860.00,862.00,SPEAKER_00," That's, that's usually what happens."
862.00,865.00,SPEAKER_00," My, my mother in a lot of people."
865.00,870.00,SPEAKER_01," Kind of like talking to someone from the south, you know, they don't really see."
870.00,872.00,SPEAKER_01, You can understand them.
873.00,874.00,SPEAKER_00, This is true.
874.00,882.00,SPEAKER_00," If you, if you do call here, you should ask for, ask for my, I know and told me you should ask to talk to my mother in law because she speaks English just fine."
882.00,886.00,SPEAKER_00," You'll have to talk slow, but she'll understand everything you say."
886.00,887.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
887.00,890.00,SPEAKER_00," It's, it's deceptive because I, I'd be talking and she understands everything."
890.00,891.00,SPEAKER_01," It's just, right."
891.00,893.00,SPEAKER_01, That's on his maiden name.
893.00,895.00,SPEAKER_00," Bowd, Bowd."
895.00,897.00,SPEAKER_00," Bowd, Bowd, okay."
897.00,899.00,SPEAKER_00, And let me give you the number.
899.00,903.00,SPEAKER_00," It's, if you're in Holland, okay, there's two numbers."
903.00,909.00,SPEAKER_00," If you're in Holland, it's 03402."
909.00,912.00,SPEAKER_00, That's the area code.
912.00,914.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, of course."
914.00,915.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
915.00,918.00,SPEAKER_01," But then it's only like five digit number, right?"
918.00,919.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, it's five digits."
919.00,920.00,SPEAKER_00, It's 03402.
920.00,928.00,SPEAKER_00," And then the actual numbers eight, eight, eight, eight, five, eight."
929.00,930.00,SPEAKER_01, I don't know.
930.00,932.00,SPEAKER_01, I may not be able to remember that one.
932.00,941.00,SPEAKER_00," And yeah, if you speak, if you speak English to the secretary's, who answer they will speak English back."
941.00,942.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
942.00,947.00,SPEAKER_00," Because the company has an American division and so there, everybody have to speak English."
947.00,948.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, great."
948.00,950.00,SPEAKER_01, So that works for you then.
950.00,951.00,SPEAKER_00," No, it doesn't."
951.00,954.00,SPEAKER_00, I have to speak Dutch during the work day.
954.00,963.00,SPEAKER_00," The company language is Dutch because the company has Dutch own, but it has a, you know, has a part, an American part."
963.00,967.00,SPEAKER_00," So everybody, and in Holland, everybody speaks English anyway."
967.00,970.00,SPEAKER_00," So, except on every."
970.00,976.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, me, older people don't, but all the younger people are the professionals they all speak English."
976.00,981.00,SPEAKER_00, All the textbooks for computer science are all in English for most part.
981.00,984.00,SPEAKER_01, What's your number outside of Holland?
984.00,992.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, just it was zero, it was zero three four, just knock off the zero and it's three four zero two and then it's all the same."
992.00,997.00,SPEAKER_00, So you only dial that first zero if you're in the country.
997.00,1000.00,SPEAKER_00, And then the country number is 31.
1000.00,1003.00,SPEAKER_01," See, dial 31 then 34 zero two."
1003.00,1008.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
1008.00,1015.00,SPEAKER_01," Hey, when you're calling the US, how do you, what do you dial, zero one one then two or six, whatever?"
1015.00,1017.00,SPEAKER_01, One icon.
1017.00,1022.00,SPEAKER_00," If I were, if I were calling, like if I were going to call you back, let's say."
1022.00,1023.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1023.00,1024.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1024.00,1028.00,SPEAKER_00," That what I would do is we have, I mean, it's a different, different system here."
1028.00,1029.00,SPEAKER_00, Mm hmm.
1029.00,1033.00,SPEAKER_00," You have to, I would just dial, I think it's America's country code is one."
1033.00,1038.00,SPEAKER_00, So I think we would dial one and then I don't know.
1038.00,1040.00,SPEAKER_00, There's some code I need to dial on the fly.
1040.00,1042.00,SPEAKER_00, I have no idea what I usually do when I call America.
1042.00,1052.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, they use my AT&T call direct AT&T dial direct thing where I call a toll free number in Holland and they put me straight through to an AT&T operator."
1052.00,1057.00,SPEAKER_00," And then they build me at American rates, which are about a third of the Dutch rates."
1057.00,1058.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1058.00,1062.00,SPEAKER_00, And they build my parents house and my parents pay it out of a bank account.
1062.00,1065.00,SPEAKER_00, It's America.
1065.00,1069.00,SPEAKER_00, So that's been handier.
1069.00,1070.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
1070.00,1085.00,SPEAKER_00," But yeah, it's still fairly, it's still fairly expensive call, but it's a lot less expensive if we do it that way than if we actually make my parents in law pay it than the Dutch have such high taxes on those."
1085.00,1087.00,SPEAKER_00, They consider the luxury to call around the world.
1087.00,1091.00,SPEAKER_00, So they tax it really high.
1091.00,1098.00,SPEAKER_00," Anyway, so you guys will be in either the 18th or the 19th and you're going to go to Amsterdam."
1098.00,1112.00,SPEAKER_00," What I would say is once you're at a hotel, why don't you call me at work and let me know where you are and then we can make arrangements that day that I can meet you in Amsterdam."
1112.00,1114.00,SPEAKER_00, And maybe I'll come by public transport.
1114.00,1120.00,SPEAKER_00, It's probably easier for me to come by public transport in Amsterdam than it is for me to come by car to be honest.
1120.00,1122.00,SPEAKER_00, The streets are small and there's no parking.
1122.00,1128.00,SPEAKER_00," So I probably will come by public transport, but I don't know. We'll see where you're staying."
1128.00,1133.00,SPEAKER_00, And there's a lot more for you guys if you want to see stuff. You can see stuff in Amsterdam.
1133.00,1140.00,SPEAKER_00," And since the days are really long, I mean it stays light here till about 10, 30, 11 o'clock at night."
1140.00,1144.00,SPEAKER_00," So if you want, we can take a ride and go see stuff at night."
1144.00,1149.00,SPEAKER_00, And I can take you to some places. We can go see some stuff.
1149.00,1151.00,SPEAKER_00, It depends on what you guys want to see.
1151.00,1157.00,SPEAKER_00, So you guys should pick out the things you want to see and let me know.
1157.00,1161.00,SPEAKER_00, And I'll sit and talk with Anya about some things that maybe we think they'd be in need for you to see.
1161.00,1165.00,SPEAKER_00," So if you don't have any ideas, we'll put something together for you."
1165.00,1170.00,SPEAKER_00," But yeah, but I can pick you up. I'll probably be there sometime around six."
1170.00,1176.00,SPEAKER_00, And we can do a quick dinner or something and then go see whatever you want to see.
1176.00,1184.00,SPEAKER_00," You want to stay Amsterdam. That's fine. If you want to go off into the countryside somewhere and see a little bit of the Holland, real Holland."
1184.00,1186.00,SPEAKER_00, We can do that too.
1186.00,1189.00,SPEAKER_01," Actually, I've been up to Holland before. It's been about two years."
1189.00,1193.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I was about two years and years ago."
1193.00,1196.00,SPEAKER_00," With your parents when you follow the station over here, right?"
1196.00,1203.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, but we got to see Denhog and places like that too, which we're obviously not going to see this time."
1203.00,1208.00,SPEAKER_01," But, um, I haven't had a Kimbin here before."
1208.00,1209.00,SPEAKER_01, No.
1209.00,1211.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
1211.00,1218.00,SPEAKER_01," But then again, I'm not sure that Kim would be interested in seeing shape headquarters and, you know, all that kind of stuff."
1218.00,1220.00,SPEAKER_01, No.
1220.00,1224.00,SPEAKER_01, It's a military thing.
1224.00,1228.00,SPEAKER_00, Would you be interested in seeing shape headquarters again?
1228.00,1230.00,SPEAKER_01," No, not really."
1230.00,1238.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, I didn't think so. Somehow I had this feeling that the military taste had been beaten out of you."
1238.00,1239.00,, Yeah.
1239.00,1242.00,SPEAKER_00, I can't say two bad things about the military.
1242.00,1246.00,SPEAKER_00, Though they still have my goods and they'll probably hold them hostage.
1246.00,1250.00,SPEAKER_00, And they own my body and soul for like another four years.
1250.00,1252.00,SPEAKER_00, So I just got to play that thing.
1252.00,1255.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, I owe four years an active reserve time."
1255.00,1257.00,SPEAKER_01, Very great.
1257.00,1259.00,SPEAKER_01, Did they do that to everyone?
1259.00,1262.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, everyone who..."
1262.00,1267.00,SPEAKER_00, Everyone who hasn't been like you went through like the 36-2 process.
1267.00,1269.00,SPEAKER_00, So you don't have it.
1269.00,1275.00,SPEAKER_00," But if you just separate normally and you haven't served at least eight years, then you owe it."
1275.00,1279.00,SPEAKER_01, And that's one of those things they just never tell you upfront.
1279.00,1281.00,SPEAKER_00," No, they never said anything."
1281.00,1288.00,SPEAKER_01, I figured there was something like that because I was in the inactive reserves the entire time I was in college too.
1288.00,1290.00,SPEAKER_01," So yeah, that's..."
1290.00,1292.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, that's the military."
1292.00,1294.00,SPEAKER_00, I have my discharge papers and everything.
1294.00,1301.00,SPEAKER_00," And I've said that, yeah, I will give you your example or a blood sample if they call me back for those."
1301.00,1310.00,SPEAKER_00, But they're going to have to pay my trip back to the States because there's no basis in Holland that I'm not going to pay out of my own expenses to go to Germany or something for them.
1310.00,1315.00,SPEAKER_00," If they want me, they can bring me back active duty and pay me for the day."
1315.00,1317.00,SPEAKER_00, They're going to drag me off somewhere.
1317.00,1321.00,SPEAKER_00," But, of course, they have to find me."
1321.00,1322.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, that's the idea."
1322.00,1327.00,SPEAKER_01," If you're in another country, I mean, then you're not planning on coming back to the US."
1327.00,1330.00,SPEAKER_01, What are they going to do even if you don't?
1330.00,1336.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, I mean, I still American citizen and I still would like to be welcome in my own country."
1336.00,1343.00,SPEAKER_00," Although, yeah, I mean, if they denied my citizenship and I became a citizen, you know, I would not be a horror either."
1343.00,1349.00,SPEAKER_00," But yeah, right now, I mean, I do want to keep my American citizenship so I kind of want to..."
1349.00,1351.00,SPEAKER_00, What's that?
1351.00,1353.00,SPEAKER_01, Are you going to try and become a dual citizen?
1353.00,1354.00,SPEAKER_01, Have dual...
1354.00,1356.00,SPEAKER_00, You can't do that.
1356.00,1366.00,SPEAKER_00," The only way to be a dual citizen is if you're born in a foreign country, like if I were born in Holland and then had American parents, then I could be a dual citizen."
1366.00,1367.00,SPEAKER_00, But you can't.
1367.00,1371.00,SPEAKER_00," If I would ask to become a citizen in Holland, I would automatically lose my American citizenship."
1371.00,1374.00,SPEAKER_01," The first, the Americans are concerned, yeah."
1374.00,1376.00,SPEAKER_00, The Dutch could care less.
1376.00,1378.00,SPEAKER_00," The Dutch would say, fine, why I'm a dual citizen, that's fine."
1378.00,1385.00,SPEAKER_00," But the Americans, as soon as you ask for another citizenship, that act of asking for it takes away your American citizenship."
1385.00,1389.00,SPEAKER_00, It's kind of stupid.
1389.00,1390.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1390.00,1397.00,SPEAKER_00," So I'm an ex-patriot, an American ex-patriot, an American living abroad."
1397.00,1400.00,SPEAKER_00, I still have to file a tax return.
1400.00,1401.00,SPEAKER_00, Do you?
1401.00,1402.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1402.00,1406.00,SPEAKER_00," But my first $75,000 worth of income is tax-free."
1406.00,1410.00,SPEAKER_00, Because long as I don't bring it back to the States.
1410.00,1411.00,SPEAKER_00," Good, please."
1411.00,1412.00,SPEAKER_01," I arrest for you, huh?"
1412.00,1415.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, they want their share."
1415.00,1417.00,SPEAKER_00, They want their piece of meat.
1417.00,1420.00,SPEAKER_00, But all foreign taxes are deductible.
1420.00,1423.00,SPEAKER_00," And my tax is here, a 50% of income."
1423.00,1429.00,SPEAKER_00," So the tax is here so much higher that, yeah, I would never have to worry about it."
1429.00,1432.00,SPEAKER_01, And then she became CEO of the company.
1432.00,1435.00,SPEAKER_01," Then maybe like $1,000 should be taxable, right?"
1435.00,1436.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1436.00,1438.00,SPEAKER_01, Somehow it reads a small amount.
1438.00,1443.00,SPEAKER_00," The problem is going to be, the problem is going to be, the on-y is American salary is taxable here."
1443.00,1448.00,SPEAKER_00," And at 50%, so we're going to owe some money to the Dutch government on her salary."
1448.00,1451.00,SPEAKER_00, So some amount that has to be deducted a certain amount.
1451.00,1454.00,SPEAKER_00, And the amount we pay the American government is deductible.
1454.00,1458.00,SPEAKER_00, But it will still owe some taxes.
1458.00,1460.00,SPEAKER_00, I don't know how it works.
1460.00,1462.00,SPEAKER_00, We're going to need to have some sort of account and do it.
1462.00,1466.00,SPEAKER_00, Because I have no clue how that all works.
1466.00,1469.00,SPEAKER_00, They don't have the quick and Dutch version.
1469.00,1472.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1472.00,1477.00,SPEAKER_00, I wouldn't trust it because it's so complicated with this international garbage.
1477.00,1481.00,SPEAKER_01, Or else that I turbo-tax with the Dutch modules.
1481.00,1484.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, somehow I just wouldn't trust it."
1484.00,1485.00,SPEAKER_00, I don't know.
1485.00,1488.00,SPEAKER_00, It's a little complicated when you're dealing with the Dutch tax form.
1488.00,1489.00,SPEAKER_00, I only had to read it non-linear.
1489.00,1491.00,SPEAKER_00, Father didn't understand the damn thing.
1491.00,1494.00,SPEAKER_00, How am I supposed to understand it?
1494.00,1497.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm really looking forward to moving to Oregon and dealing with Oregon.
1497.00,1499.00,SPEAKER_01, You pay state tax Washington.
1499.00,1500.00,SPEAKER_01, You don't.
1500.00,1502.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm looking forward to that.
1502.00,1504.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, but you'll be a student."
1504.00,1507.00,SPEAKER_00, So what is your income?
1507.00,1515.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, see, I think it'll probably be about $5,000 for the portion of next year that I'm in Oregon."
1515.00,1517.00,SPEAKER_01, For the portion of this year that I'm in Oregon.
1517.00,1520.00,SPEAKER_01," And then next year it'll be $11,000."
1520.00,1525.00,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, but you'll be below the poverty line at that level."
1525.00,1528.00,SPEAKER_00," So I mean, anything can come that year."
1528.00,1533.00,SPEAKER_01," But then I've already made say like $15,000 or whatever here in Washington."
1533.00,1537.00,SPEAKER_00, But that should be non-taxable out of state income.
1537.00,1542.00,SPEAKER_01," It should, but you know, it's not going to be a fun tax return here."
1542.00,1546.00,SPEAKER_00, I had that when I went to the military.
1546.00,1548.00,SPEAKER_00, I had to file three tax.
1548.00,1554.00,SPEAKER_00," I had to file Georgia, Kansas, and then my federal."
1554.00,1557.00,SPEAKER_00, So.
1557.00,1563.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, actually I think this phone goes just about to end because it's only half an hour."
1563.00,1569.00,SPEAKER_01," So it's the, I'll give you a call when we arrive in, or maybe I'll just call you when we get in Holland."
1569.00,1571.00,SPEAKER_01, Just to let you know we're there.
1571.00,1577.00,SPEAKER_01, So if we get in the 18th or the 19th and then call you back when we get to a hotel or something like that.
1577.00,1579.00,SPEAKER_00," Okay, that's a, that's a great idea."
1579.00,1588.00,SPEAKER_00," If you, if you soon as you get into Holland and you get yourself settled, you can call me and if it's at night, just call on his parents."
1588.00,1589.00,SPEAKER_01," Okay, so."
1589.00,1592.00,SPEAKER_00," And remember that if you dial in Holland, you need to add a zero."
1592.00,1595.00,SPEAKER_00," So like right now it's, it's 1-8-1-0 area code."
1595.00,1599.00,SPEAKER_00," If you dial in Holland, it's 0-1-8-1-0."
1599.00,1601.00,SPEAKER_00, In Holland.
1601.00,1606.00,SPEAKER_00," And, and then yeah, you can just call up if it's, if it's during the work hours, fine, call me at work."
1606.00,1609.00,SPEAKER_00," If not, call on his parents."
1609.00,1613.00,SPEAKER_00," If you don't have a new phone number for me, and if you do, I'll send it by email."
1613.00,1616.00,SPEAKER_00," If I get it before this weekend, we'll email you something."
1616.00,1618.00,SPEAKER_00," But if you don't get email, then just call on his parents."
1618.00,1621.00,SPEAKER_00," If we have a phone by then, they'll be able to give you the number."
1621.00,1624.00,SPEAKER_00, And just remember to ask for her mother.
1624.00,1627.00,SPEAKER_01," And it's, booed, right?"
1627.00,1628.00,SPEAKER_01, Boed.
1628.00,1629.00,SPEAKER_01, Boed.
1629.00,1630.00,, Boed.
1630.00,1632.00,SPEAKER_00," Boed as in a, a, a, a, a."
1632.00,1633.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
1633.00,1634.00,SPEAKER_01, Great.
1634.00,1644.00,SPEAKER_00," And yeah, and I think, it's, it's not frow."
1644.00,1647.00,SPEAKER_00," It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a moverau."
1647.00,1654.00,SPEAKER_00," Moverau is the, is, you know, it's a, it's a, a frow and German, it's a frow."
1654.00,1656.00,SPEAKER_00," And then Dutch, it's moverau."
1656.00,1658.00,SPEAKER_01, I'll probably never remember that.
1658.00,1659.00,SPEAKER_00, So.
1659.00,1660.00,SPEAKER_00," Nah, I don't worry about it."
1660.00,1661.00,SPEAKER_00, I think he's called our misses.
1661.00,1662.00,SPEAKER_00, You can just call our misses and speaking.
1662.00,1665.00,SPEAKER_00, You're sure she understands his talks slowly and clearly.
1665.00,1666.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
1666.00,1668.00,SPEAKER_00," And once you're in Holland, the line will be really clear."
1668.00,1670.00,SPEAKER_00," I mean, the phones here are pretty good."
1670.00,1678.00,SPEAKER_00," Once you're in the country, it's just these, over, over America, America, it's always kind of, iffy."
1678.00,1679.00,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
1679.00,1681.00,SPEAKER_00, But I look forward to seeing you guys.
1681.00,1682.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1682.00,1683.00,SPEAKER_00, We did too.
1683.00,1684.00,SPEAKER_00," And yeah, we wanted to."
1684.00,1688.00,SPEAKER_01," It's a, It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a good job there."
1688.00,1689.00,SPEAKER_00, Thanks a lot.
1689.00,1690.00,SPEAKER_00, Sure.
1690.00,1691.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1691.00,1697.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, I'll get to see you guys at some point and we'll hook up and maybe we can go for a drive in the country or whatever you guys want to do."
1697.00,1706.00,SPEAKER_00," Pick out some places and I'll talk to on you about some things that you can see, you know, if you don't have any ideas and maybe we can go for dinner in the country or something or."
1706.00,1707.00,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
1707.00,1708.00,SPEAKER_01, You know.
1708.00,1709.00,SPEAKER_00," So, the country."
1709.00,1710.00,," So, the country."
1710.00,1711.00,SPEAKER_01, What's that?
1711.00,1712.00,SPEAKER_01, What was the company card?
1712.00,1713.00,SPEAKER_01, They give you a Ferrari.
1713.00,1714.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1714.00,1715.00,SPEAKER_00, Right.
1715.00,1717.00,SPEAKER_00, I got a Mitsubishi Colt.
1717.00,1720.00,SPEAKER_01, They didn't even give you a Dutch card or European card.
1720.00,1722.00,SPEAKER_00, I don't really want it.
1722.00,1723.00,SPEAKER_00, European or Dutch card.
1723.00,1724.00,SPEAKER_00, I'm very happy with them.
1724.00,1725.00,SPEAKER_00, Mitsubishi.
1725.00,1726.00,SPEAKER_00, Actually.
1726.00,1727.00,SPEAKER_01, You wouldn't want to.
1727.00,1728.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1728.00,1729.00,SPEAKER_00," Oh, and I'll think of your Mercedes."
1729.00,1730.00,SPEAKER_00, That would be fine.
1730.00,1737.00,SPEAKER_00, But I don't think the company is going to be giving me a Mercedes or BMW anytime real soon.
1737.00,1741.00,SPEAKER_00," But it does work on, unlike LPG liquid propane gas."
1741.00,1742.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, does it?"
1742.00,1744.00,SPEAKER_00," And yeah, and gas and regular gasoline."
1744.00,1746.00,SPEAKER_00," So it's, it's kind of interesting."
1746.00,1749.00,SPEAKER_00, It's kind of interesting experience.
1749.00,1751.00,SPEAKER_00," But yeah, it's a nice little card."
1751.00,1755.00,SPEAKER_00," And I think special but it came with a radio, which is kind of not standard here in Holland."
1755.00,1756.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, yeah."
1756.00,1757.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1757.00,1759.00,SPEAKER_01," It probably gets a good gas mileage, which is really important over there."
1759.00,1761.00,SPEAKER_01, It's a four bucks a gallon.
1761.00,1762.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, yeah."
1762.00,1766.00,SPEAKER_00, Right now it's not getting good gas mileage because it's in its break-in period.
1766.00,1767.00,SPEAKER_00, Oh.
1767.00,1769.00,SPEAKER_00, And I have to use gasoline.
1769.00,1775.00,SPEAKER_00," But once I switch over to liquid propane gas, the cost is the same as gas in America."
1775.00,1776.00,SPEAKER_01, Oh.
1776.00,1777.00,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1777.00,1778.00,SPEAKER_00, So liquid propane is a lot cheaper.
1778.00,1781.00,SPEAKER_00, But or liquid petrol gas.
1781.00,1782.00,SPEAKER_00, I don't know what the hell the stuff is.
1782.00,1783.00,SPEAKER_00," It's propane, I think."
1783.00,1785.00,SPEAKER_00, But I don't know.
1785.00,1791.00,SPEAKER_00," All I know is this, this different hookup I have not had yet used because I have to burn it in with regular benzene."
1791.00,1792.00,SPEAKER_00, Benzene is gas.
1792.00,1794.00,SPEAKER_00, I'm a gas American gas.
1794.00,1798.00,SPEAKER_00, And so I'm working my way into it.
1798.00,1799.00,SPEAKER_00, But anyway.
1799.00,1800.00,SPEAKER_00, But anyway.
