0.00,14.00,SPEAKER_02, I'm calling you.
14.00,27.00,SPEAKER_02," You missed the lower recording after I pressed one, but I got this free telephone call, but our telephone conversation is being recorded for like linguistics or something."
27.00,29.00,SPEAKER_02, You're setting linguistics.
29.00,37.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, the Southern are in Africa. That's an interesting linguistics that I'll throw them off."
37.00,43.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, I'm so glad you thought of calling us with your 3rd, 30-minute phone call that course."
43.00,46.00,SPEAKER_01," Well, what's new? Tell me everything."
46.00,48.00,SPEAKER_01, What's new with you?
48.00,51.00,SPEAKER_01, I don't want to just beg and lie.
51.00,55.00,SPEAKER_01," Real seven months pregnant, so you're doing September, right?"
55.00,59.00,SPEAKER_01," Yes, September six, so it's not really that far off."
59.00,64.00,SPEAKER_01," As a matter of fact, I was just laying down and reading my book on breastfeeding."
64.00,69.00,SPEAKER_02, Excellent. You guys know if it's a boy or a girl yet?
69.00,72.00,SPEAKER_01," No, we're going to let it be a surprise."
72.00,75.00,SPEAKER_02, Cool. Did you get a voice name yet?
75.00,76.00,SPEAKER_02, It's not Bruno.
76.00,78.00,SPEAKER_02," No, we're here."
78.00,80.00,SPEAKER_01," No, we're still having trouble with that."
80.00,84.00,SPEAKER_01," As a matter of fact, Mark decided this weekend, we're supposed to decide what it's going to be."
84.00,90.00,SPEAKER_01, So I guess I need to start actually looking at my baby name book.
90.00,93.00,SPEAKER_01, But we like the name Renata for a girl.
93.00,95.00,SPEAKER_01, That's pretty.
95.00,99.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, it's kind of a German name, Renata."
99.00,105.00,SPEAKER_01," But we haven't really picked a middle name, so that's still a problem too."
105.00,110.00,SPEAKER_01," But everybody's like, my mother."
110.00,113.00,SPEAKER_01, Elizabeth! What a job!
113.00,115.00,SPEAKER_01, What a good name.
115.00,118.00,SPEAKER_01," So it's interesting, the suggestions everybody has."
118.00,120.00,SPEAKER_01, We really don't want a junior.
120.00,123.00,SPEAKER_01, We don't want to mark junior or anything like that.
123.00,126.00,SPEAKER_01, It's been hard.
126.00,130.00,SPEAKER_01, But did I write you after we went down to Cape Town?
130.00,131.00,SPEAKER_01, No.
131.00,135.00,SPEAKER_01," I want to tell you about it, because you've been talking off on about coming."
135.00,137.00,SPEAKER_01, But we went down to Cape Town in June.
137.00,139.00,SPEAKER_01, It was really great.
139.00,142.00,SPEAKER_01, It was our first trip to really see another part of Africa.
142.00,144.00,SPEAKER_01, It was outstanding.
144.00,145.00,SPEAKER_01, Really?
145.00,147.00,SPEAKER_01, It was so beautiful.
147.00,156.00,SPEAKER_01," We drove all the way down to the point, the very tip of Africa, and saw where the Indian and the Atlantic oceans meet."
156.00,158.00,SPEAKER_01, It was so beautiful.
158.00,161.00,SPEAKER_02, Where the oceans meet is.
161.00,162.00,SPEAKER_02, Where the oceans meet is.
162.00,164.00,SPEAKER_02, There are big water that comes up.
164.00,165.00,SPEAKER_02, It's too tight to meet.
165.00,166.00,SPEAKER_01, No!
166.00,167.00,SPEAKER_01," Actually, no."
167.00,171.00,SPEAKER_01," It's a little bit rougher, but you probably wouldn't know otherwise."
171.00,174.00,SPEAKER_01, It's not like big or anything.
174.00,179.00,SPEAKER_01," But the water is choppier, like you expect the Atlantic to be."
179.00,186.00,SPEAKER_01, But the whole scape is pretty because it's like the big mountains just cutting right down into the water.
186.00,187.00,SPEAKER_01, It's very pretty.
187.00,191.00,SPEAKER_01," We even saw the baboons, or just natural down there."
191.00,192.00,SPEAKER_01, We're driving along us.
192.00,195.00,SPEAKER_01, And these baboons came running along the side of the road.
195.00,197.00,SPEAKER_01," It was a little baboon, babies."
197.00,199.00,SPEAKER_01, It was really neat.
199.00,202.00,SPEAKER_01, And we went up into the wine country.
202.00,204.00,SPEAKER_01, That was also very nice.
204.00,206.00,SPEAKER_01, They have a good wine there.
206.00,208.00,SPEAKER_00," Well, I don't know."
208.00,211.00,SPEAKER_01," Unfortunately, I was able to sample."
211.00,213.00,SPEAKER_01," But Mark, we got about three cases."
213.00,217.00,SPEAKER_01," Because every one, we went to, we're like, Yeah, let's get some of that."
217.00,219.00,SPEAKER_01, Let's get some of that.
219.00,222.00,SPEAKER_01, So we've got quite the wine load.
222.00,225.00,SPEAKER_01," I keep saying, save some for me."
225.00,228.00,SPEAKER_01, But Mark's parents were down here.
228.00,231.00,SPEAKER_01, We were kind of traveling around with them.
231.00,237.00,SPEAKER_01," And they went to, I couldn't go to Victoria Falls, or the game park with him because you have to take malaria medicine."
237.00,239.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, that's what you were saying."
239.00,241.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, but they loved it."
241.00,242.00,SPEAKER_01, Victoria Falls is great.
242.00,245.00,SPEAKER_01, And the pictures they brought back were just fantastic.
245.00,247.00,SPEAKER_01, Tom dying.
247.00,249.00,SPEAKER_01, Hopefully I get to go.
249.00,253.00,SPEAKER_02," Hey, you said you were going to go to some barbecue too and meet a bunch of other American herb."
253.00,254.00,SPEAKER_02, Did I miss that?
254.00,255.00,SPEAKER_02, What?
255.00,256.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I did."
256.00,258.00,SPEAKER_01, You can't remember who I wrote what?
258.00,261.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, the American Society picnic or something."
261.00,262.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
262.00,263.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, it was pretty fun."
263.00,271.00,SPEAKER_01," As a matter of fact, I met the ambassador for South Africa, the American ambassador for South Africa."
271.00,276.00,SPEAKER_01," Because he was, he's, it was, the picnic was held at his residence in Pretoria."
276.00,277.00,SPEAKER_01, No.
277.00,279.00,SPEAKER_01, He was the biggest dream.
279.00,281.00,SPEAKER_01, Oh my God.
281.00,285.00,SPEAKER_01, He was wearing a polyester leisure suit with bell bottom.
285.00,288.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm not going away.
288.00,289.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, yes."
289.00,290.00,SPEAKER_01, And we played the man in.
290.00,293.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, he's like the big guy."
293.00,301.00,SPEAKER_01," Like when Al Gore comes to visit South Africa, and later this year, you know, like he's the, the big guy."
301.00,302.00,SPEAKER_01, He's the best.
302.00,305.00,SPEAKER_01, The pants were like blue checked.
305.00,308.00,SPEAKER_01, And the black Americans were like that?
308.00,310.00,SPEAKER_01, I don't know.
310.00,313.00,SPEAKER_01," I mean, there's enough normal people running around."
313.00,315.00,SPEAKER_01," It was just, you say, gosh, the ambassador."
315.00,319.00,SPEAKER_01," He would be really, you know, well dressed."
319.00,320.00,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
320.00,321.00,SPEAKER_01, All this.
321.00,326.00,SPEAKER_01," But he was, he was a nice enough man that I couldn't believe it."
326.00,331.00,SPEAKER_01," I always just, I talked to him for the longest time, not even knowing who he was."
331.00,332.00,SPEAKER_01, I bet there's a big cave up.
332.00,334.00,SPEAKER_01, It says about a bastard of this.
334.00,336.00,SPEAKER_01," And I was like, oh my God."
336.00,340.00,SPEAKER_01, What is the guy I could do?
340.00,343.00,SPEAKER_01, So it was pretty wild.
343.00,346.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, we met some, a lot of American people."
346.00,351.00,SPEAKER_01," As a matter of fact, one of the women there is like a breastfeeding counselor."
351.00,355.00,SPEAKER_01," And since I'm obviously pregnant, she came up and was chatting with me."
355.00,357.00,SPEAKER_01," And it was, it was real nice."
357.00,358.00,SPEAKER_01, Cool.
358.00,362.00,SPEAKER_01, Mark played volleyball with all the Marines that were hanging around.
362.00,365.00,SPEAKER_01, That was nice.
365.00,366.00,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
366.00,371.00,SPEAKER_02, I met talking about meat and meat people.
371.00,373.00,SPEAKER_02, I woke up on morning and my ear was bleeding.
373.00,375.00,SPEAKER_02, This was just last week.
375.00,376.00,SPEAKER_02, Oh no.
376.00,378.00,SPEAKER_02," And I called, well, it bleeds occasionally."
378.00,384.00,SPEAKER_02," But for some reason, this morning I said, I'm going to call and at least get this on record that my ear is waiting."
384.00,386.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, my doctor was out."
386.00,389.00,SPEAKER_02, So I saw this other doctor.
389.00,395.00,SPEAKER_02," So coincidentally, I woke up with an ear bleeding, and coincidentally for some unknown reason, I decided to call the doctor."
395.00,399.00,SPEAKER_02," And coincidentally, my doctor was on vacation, and I got this other doctor."
399.00,401.00,SPEAKER_02, And I was his last appointment.
401.00,403.00,SPEAKER_02, Oh my gosh.
403.00,405.00,SPEAKER_02, So he had all the time in the world to talk to me.
405.00,408.00,SPEAKER_02," And he started out talking, and he asked me what I did."
408.00,411.00,SPEAKER_02," And I said, well, I'm an engineer and blah, blah, blah."
411.00,413.00,SPEAKER_02," But actually, I'm preparing to go to medical school."
413.00,416.00,SPEAKER_02," And he said, well, please, talk to me before he'd do that."
416.00,421.00,SPEAKER_02, We chatted for an hour and 15 minutes or so.
421.00,427.00,SPEAKER_02," I mean, I had a doctor's appointment in there too, but I'd say most of the time it was just he and I chatting about school."
427.00,431.00,SPEAKER_02," At the end of it, yeah, it was really nice."
431.00,440.00,SPEAKER_02," And at the end of it, he said something like, yeah, medicine really needs some brilliant and motivated people to go to school right now."
440.00,442.00,SPEAKER_02," And I said, well, I am both of those."
442.00,443.00,SPEAKER_02," And he said, I know you are."
443.00,450.00,SPEAKER_02," And if you want a recommendation, drop me your resume and a little letter, and I'll send a recommendation for you."
450.00,455.00,SPEAKER_02," I don't know what a recommendation from the head of the, he is the head, coincidentally too."
455.00,460.00,SPEAKER_02, He's the head of this department at Jewish Hospital here in St. Louis.
460.00,462.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, that's great."
462.00,465.00,SPEAKER_02," Hey, no, is that my lucky day or what?"
465.00,468.00,SPEAKER_01," You could, people are surprised."
468.00,472.00,SPEAKER_01, Other students would be just dying for a recommendation like that.
472.00,475.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, that's wonderful."
475.00,478.00,SPEAKER_02," So, how's the Wedwood School start?"
478.00,481.00,SPEAKER_02," Well, I'm applying for 96 admission."
481.00,482.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, yeah."
482.00,484.00,SPEAKER_02, But I don't know if I'll get in.
484.00,485.00,SPEAKER_02, In 96.
485.00,488.00,SPEAKER_01," I'll tell you, Sam, you sound like just like one of my friends."
488.00,494.00,SPEAKER_01," He's finally finishing up medical school, but at the first he was like, oh, I don't know if I'm going to get in."
494.00,497.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, you know, we were all like, oh, you know, it'll be fine."
497.00,498.00,SPEAKER_01, And it all worked out.
498.00,501.00,SPEAKER_01," And he's about to become a doctor, you know, he's so."
501.00,503.00,SPEAKER_01, Where'd he go to school?
503.00,507.00,SPEAKER_01," I don't know the name of school, but it was in, it's in, oh, God."
507.00,510.00,SPEAKER_01, It's that town on the coast in South Carolina.
510.00,513.00,SPEAKER_02, Don't work in our coast in South Carolina.
513.00,516.00,SPEAKER_01," Savannah, no, not Savannah."
516.00,518.00,SPEAKER_01," What, Mark?"
518.00,519.00,SPEAKER_01, He's a child.
519.00,520.00,SPEAKER_01, I'm a child.
520.00,523.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, talk about a swank location too."
523.00,524.00,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, really."
524.00,526.00,SPEAKER_02, That's a nice location.
526.00,529.00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, he was, but he's just finishing up."
529.00,533.00,SPEAKER_01," So you remind me of him, like, oh, I don't know."
533.00,535.00,SPEAKER_02," Oh, he was able to get in."
535.00,536.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, yeah."
536.00,537.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, yeah."
537.00,539.00,SPEAKER_01, So he did find it was really hard.
539.00,543.00,SPEAKER_01," And he talked to me, he's like, oh, boy, you know, I'm just exhausted."
543.00,545.00,SPEAKER_01, But he's really thrilled now.
545.00,548.00,SPEAKER_01, So he'll work out if that's what you really want.
548.00,550.00,SPEAKER_01, That is what I really want on that.
550.00,552.00,SPEAKER_01," Oh, that's all you need then."
552.00,555.00,SPEAKER_01," You know, really, yep."
555.00,561.00,SPEAKER_01," Boy, you put yourself through the paces though, engineering, and school, and then medical school."
561.00,564.00,SPEAKER_01," Aww, sucker for an abuse, huh?"
564.00,575.84,SPEAKER_02," This summer is hilarious, because I'm going to class and I'm trying to study for this exam and like this weekend this is my fun for the weekend talking to you the rest of the weekend I'm studying"
