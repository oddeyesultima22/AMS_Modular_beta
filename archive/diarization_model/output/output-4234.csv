0.00,2.72,SPEAKER_01, So are you going to ask me an discrete question?
2.72,6.12,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, we're going to say we better talk in discrete question, Sven."
6.12,9.72,SPEAKER_02, So I hope I didn't wake you.
9.72,10.72,SPEAKER_01," No, no."
10.72,11.72,SPEAKER_01, It's no problem.
11.72,12.72,SPEAKER_02, It's not at all.
12.72,15.32,SPEAKER_02," It's about 10, but I just I just got to go with me till that."
15.32,16.32,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
16.32,17.76,SPEAKER_02, So this is a free phone call.
17.76,20.00,SPEAKER_02, I can even talk half an hour if we want to.
20.00,22.40,SPEAKER_02," But it's recorded, so you know."
22.40,23.40,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
23.40,27.20,SPEAKER_02," None of those illegal activities, okay?"
27.20,28.20,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
28.20,29.56,SPEAKER_01, So we have to talk about business.
29.56,30.56,SPEAKER_02, No.
30.56,31.56,SPEAKER_02, No.
31.56,33.96,SPEAKER_02, You don't have to talk about business.
33.96,36.36,SPEAKER_02, So how are you?
36.36,40.96,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I'm trying to the state Saturday to New York."
40.96,41.96,SPEAKER_02," Oh, you are."
41.96,44.84,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, if the visit Nancy in New York."
44.84,48.76,SPEAKER_02," This is one of your annual trips, or do you have a good idea?"
48.76,50.56,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, it's a renewal or a..."
50.56,51.56,SPEAKER_01," No, no, no."
51.56,57.56,SPEAKER_01," It's just well, I have to take a few days of vacation because I'm switching jobs at the beginning of September."
57.56,58.56,SPEAKER_02, Oh.
59.56,67.00,SPEAKER_01," All of that that I was pining about when we last met come true, I'm going to be the number one in Düsseldorf."
67.00,68.00,SPEAKER_00, Mm-hmm.
68.00,83.80,SPEAKER_01," But the situation is in Cologne, it has deteriorated rapidly, which I can explain my boss got more or less canned."
83.80,84.80,SPEAKER_01, Oh.
84.80,85.80,SPEAKER_01," And, you know, from..."
85.80,86.80,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
86.80,89.56,SPEAKER_01," Just from, you know, one minute to the next."
89.56,90.56,SPEAKER_01, Oh.
90.56,94.16,SPEAKER_01, And I got stuck with being the boss.
94.16,95.16,SPEAKER_00, Mm-hmm.
95.16,100.32,SPEAKER_01," And 20 hours later, they offered me the job in Düsseldorf."
100.32,105.68,SPEAKER_01, So it was really a very strange couple of days there in April.
105.68,106.68,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
106.68,112.88,SPEAKER_01," I don't know why this happened, but I must have done something right at some point."
112.88,113.88,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
113.88,114.88,SPEAKER_02, Hey.
114.88,116.32,SPEAKER_02, You knew the right people and you've been doing good.
116.80,117.32,SPEAKER_01, Right.
117.32,119.16,SPEAKER_01, You knew the right people.
119.16,120.16,SPEAKER_01, Keep my nose clean.
120.16,121.16,SPEAKER_01, That's right.
121.16,125.36,SPEAKER_02, So now you can change everything around like you like it.
125.36,126.36,, Yeah.
126.36,128.56,SPEAKER_01, In the fact that we have no money.
128.56,129.56,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
129.56,130.56,SPEAKER_01, You can change it.
130.56,132.12,SPEAKER_02, And if you got to have any challenges.
132.12,133.12,SPEAKER_01, Right.
133.12,134.12,SPEAKER_01, Civil service.
134.12,136.12,SPEAKER_01," You know, you have to change everything with no money."
136.12,137.12,, Mm-hmm.
137.12,138.92,SPEAKER_01," But other than that, everything's..."
138.92,139.92,SPEAKER_01, No.
139.92,141.32,SPEAKER_01," I mean, that's very good."
141.32,142.32,SPEAKER_01, I'm very excited.
142.32,143.32,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
143.32,144.32,SPEAKER_02," I'm a good, exciting."
144.32,150.08,SPEAKER_01, And I gave it that we had to celebrate as our 150th anniversary music school last week.
150.08,158.68,SPEAKER_01," And I gave it a little speech in the city hall and, you know, the mayor gave a speech which I wrote for him and all that kind of stuff."
158.68,159.68,SPEAKER_02, Wow.
159.68,161.68,SPEAKER_02, Sounds impressive.
161.68,162.68,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
162.68,163.68,SPEAKER_01, For some modest.
163.68,167.04,SPEAKER_01," No, actually, it really was very nice."
167.04,168.04,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
168.04,169.04,SPEAKER_01," Good feeling, yeah."
169.04,170.04,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
171.04,174.64,SPEAKER_02," It's quite an event and you're lucky that you're there at that time, you know?"
174.64,175.64,SPEAKER_01, Right.
175.64,176.64,SPEAKER_02, Right.
176.64,178.80,SPEAKER_02, And more press and stuff for the school itself.
178.80,179.80,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
179.80,180.80,SPEAKER_02, Which is good.
180.80,182.60,SPEAKER_02, So that's a good thing.
182.60,183.60,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
183.60,184.60,SPEAKER_02, And that...
184.60,187.60,SPEAKER_02," Well, the one important thing I'd better ask you before I forget, but it doesn't matter."
187.60,189.08,SPEAKER_02," See, I had this one pre-phone call."
189.08,190.48,SPEAKER_02," I said, oh, why not Peter?"
190.48,191.48,SPEAKER_01," Oh, yeah."
191.48,193.64,SPEAKER_01, Since you don't know anyone in Korea.
193.64,195.80,SPEAKER_02," Oh, no, it has to be somebody who speaks English."
195.80,196.80,SPEAKER_02," Oh, so."
196.80,197.80,SPEAKER_02, Two.
197.80,198.80,SPEAKER_02," You see, that's the problem."
199.28,202.52,SPEAKER_02," Because what it is, actually, I should tell you, it's..."
202.52,211.16,SPEAKER_02," I think it's some research for computer, for voice recognition and, you know, some people could talk normally to a computer."
211.16,218.68,SPEAKER_02, And then it could actually begin to maybe transpose what you wrote or all sorts of things like that.
218.68,221.28,SPEAKER_01, Into a voice or...
221.28,223.72,SPEAKER_02," Into text, right, if you were talking."
223.80,229.80,SPEAKER_01, I thought you'd take the text that we speak and get turned into English.
229.80,230.80,SPEAKER_02, Yes.
230.80,233.44,SPEAKER_02," And it would get rid of all those, I hope."
233.44,237.48,SPEAKER_01," I thought I thought, yeah."
237.48,238.68,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, I don't know."
238.68,239.68,SPEAKER_02, I don't know.
239.68,247.56,SPEAKER_02," I just seen this on the computer and I said, oh, I can take advantage of this and I signed up my mother and my grandmother, because they're also doing research in German, too."
247.56,248.56,SPEAKER_00, Mm-hmm.
248.56,251.96,SPEAKER_02, And they have to be native German speakers on each side.
251.96,252.96,SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.
252.96,253.96,SPEAKER_01, So...
253.96,256.16,SPEAKER_01, So we don't qualify.
256.16,257.16,SPEAKER_02, We don't qualify.
257.16,261.68,SPEAKER_02, And I think that we'll drive them crazy when they do German with so many different dialects.
261.68,262.68,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
262.68,265.16,SPEAKER_02, I read every native German.
265.16,266.16,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
266.16,269.04,SPEAKER_01," Well, they don't know what they're into."
269.04,270.04,SPEAKER_01, They're in for.
270.04,271.04,SPEAKER_02, All right.
271.04,272.48,SPEAKER_02, That's probably why they need so many.
272.48,273.48,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
273.48,274.48,SPEAKER_02, And that...
274.48,276.40,SPEAKER_02, But here is another thing.
276.40,277.40,SPEAKER_02, I have...
277.40,278.80,SPEAKER_02," You got my postcard, right?"
278.80,280.64,SPEAKER_02," I was in Europe, but I didn't make it to see."
280.64,281.64,SPEAKER_01," Right, yeah."
281.72,283.64,SPEAKER_02," Sorry, but at all these places..."
283.64,285.64,SPEAKER_01," Well, you know, Europe is a big place."
285.64,287.12,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, actually, right."
287.12,288.32,SPEAKER_02, And the weather was so horrible.
288.32,289.84,SPEAKER_02, I didn't have that great of a trip.
289.84,290.84,SPEAKER_02, No.
290.84,293.44,SPEAKER_02," When I was there, the whole time it was freezing cold and rain."
293.44,295.24,SPEAKER_01, But now it's very hot.
295.24,296.24,SPEAKER_02," You know, it's hot."
296.24,297.44,SPEAKER_02, And I wouldn't have gotten this...
297.44,301.04,SPEAKER_02," I got a terrible cold, too, because the weather was so bad."
301.04,305.16,SPEAKER_02," So when you're lucky, you'll see that you're coming to New York this coming week."
305.16,308.24,SPEAKER_02, It was a previously when it was so hot.
308.24,311.52,SPEAKER_02, I think the weather has broken.
311.52,312.52,SPEAKER_01, That's good.
312.52,313.52,SPEAKER_02, Because that's even worse.
313.52,314.52,SPEAKER_02, I think...
314.52,316.52,SPEAKER_02," Oh, yeah, New York is horrible."
316.52,321.52,SPEAKER_02," Well, that beat, I should go out to the long island or something."
321.52,324.52,SPEAKER_01," Well, I'll be stuck in Manhattan, Nancy."
324.52,325.52,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
325.52,333.20,SPEAKER_02," Well, but I'm calling because there is a possibility I may be going back again in August."
333.20,338.40,SPEAKER_02, And I wondered if you were around August 12th.
338.40,345.40,SPEAKER_01," I think the next weekend I won't be here, but can you hold the line effect?"
345.40,346.40,SPEAKER_01, I'm sure it does.
346.40,347.40,SPEAKER_01, It doesn't matter.
347.40,348.40,SPEAKER_01, It's hardly hard.
348.40,349.40,SPEAKER_01, It's hardly hard.
349.40,350.40,SPEAKER_02, It's hardly hard.
350.40,351.40,SPEAKER_02, It's hardly hard.
351.40,352.40,SPEAKER_02, It's hardly hard.
352.40,353.40,SPEAKER_01, I'll tell the computer something interesting.
353.40,354.40,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
354.40,358.40,SPEAKER_02, That would be funny.
369.40,375.40,, See that?
375.40,382.40,SPEAKER_01, I'll be here.
382.40,383.40,SPEAKER_01, See it radically?
383.40,384.40,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
384.40,389.40,SPEAKER_02," You mean, you carry multiple calendars so you don't know?"
389.40,392.40,SPEAKER_01," But I do have two, one in the office and one at home."
392.40,397.40,SPEAKER_01," The weekend after that, I will not be in town."
397.40,402.40,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I see you at the exam here."
402.40,403.40,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
403.40,405.40,SPEAKER_02, I haven't decided whether I'm doing this yet.
405.40,407.40,SPEAKER_02," It is a bit silly, you know?"
407.40,410.40,SPEAKER_02, I wasn't just there.
410.40,413.40,SPEAKER_02, But I've been the next weekend.
413.40,414.40,SPEAKER_02, I'm again.
414.40,426.40,SPEAKER_02," I'm invited to see the child of my favorite cousin, who's being baptized and they want me to be the Godmother of the English English."
426.40,433.40,SPEAKER_02," And so, since I didn't go to their wedding, I was feeling this big pressure."
433.40,437.40,SPEAKER_02, I should have gone to the wedding last year.
437.40,442.40,SPEAKER_02, They started asking me when I was on vacation already.
442.40,446.40,SPEAKER_02, It's easy to think about doing it when you're on vacation.
446.40,450.40,SPEAKER_02," I get this idea when you're at work and say, oh, I can't go in four weeks."
450.40,453.40,SPEAKER_02, How could I possibly just do that?
453.40,454.40,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I know the feeling."
454.40,456.40,SPEAKER_02, I'm a once-year invocation mode.
456.40,457.40,SPEAKER_02, It's very likely.
457.40,458.40,SPEAKER_02," Well, why shouldn't I?"
458.40,464.40,SPEAKER_02, I have the vacation just to know the time and the money and what is money for?
464.40,465.40,SPEAKER_01, Right.
465.40,468.40,SPEAKER_01," So I have to say, you sound like you're the bank."
468.40,475.40,SPEAKER_02," No, but I have to make up my mind here by Friday because that's when I can hold my ticket too."
475.40,481.40,SPEAKER_02, So I saw I could go to ticket and I just have to have a discussion with my boss.
481.40,487.40,SPEAKER_01," So you have to let me know what you think, what this entails as consequences for me."
487.40,488.40,SPEAKER_01," Oh, yes."
488.40,491.40,SPEAKER_02," Oh, there are good consequences if you're willing."
491.40,496.40,SPEAKER_02," I mean, aside from, so I have to be there on the 20th in Berlin, okay?"
496.40,499.40,SPEAKER_02," And I couldn't go for, you know, just three days."
499.40,502.40,SPEAKER_02, So I had to go at least a week.
502.40,503.40,SPEAKER_02, And there wasn't advantage.
503.40,506.40,SPEAKER_02," It's because, and if you'd like to join me, I'd love it."
506.40,511.40,SPEAKER_02, I was also invited to a wedding on the 12th somewhere near Dufle Dorf.
511.40,515.40,SPEAKER_02, Between Dufle Dorf and Essen.
515.40,517.40,SPEAKER_01, I can only be rotting in or...
517.40,521.40,SPEAKER_02," No, it's north of Rottingen because I've seen a map, but it's in a small thing."
521.40,527.40,SPEAKER_02," Oh, kept, kept, kept, kept, kept, kept, kept, kept, big, kept, big, yes."
527.40,528.40,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, that's almost, this is off."
528.40,529.40,SPEAKER_01," All right, that's almost Essen."
529.40,531.40,SPEAKER_02," Okay, whichever."
531.40,532.40,SPEAKER_02, I suppose that's close.
532.40,535.40,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, it's not far through the S-bond here."
535.40,536.40,SPEAKER_01," I mean, it's like 20 minutes."
536.40,537.40,SPEAKER_01, There's something.
537.40,540.40,SPEAKER_02," And so if I do it, I'd love to have you join me."
540.40,542.40,SPEAKER_02, It's a fancy wedding too.
542.40,544.40,SPEAKER_01, Does that mean I have to get...
544.40,546.40,SPEAKER_01, That's where I tie.
546.40,547.40,SPEAKER_02, Sure.
547.40,558.40,SPEAKER_02," I mean, it's actually, I can't believe this is a German friend that I've, he worked here at NASA for like two years and was in our, our German conversation club."
558.40,559.40,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
559.40,560.40,SPEAKER_02, And you're wearing a German woman.
560.40,562.40,SPEAKER_02," I mean, he just went back a little while ago because..."
562.40,564.40,SPEAKER_01," He's in a medical, but he's making a German woman."
564.40,565.40,SPEAKER_01," Oh, he's a German."
565.40,566.40,SPEAKER_02, He's German too.
566.40,567.40,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
567.40,568.40,SPEAKER_02, They're both German.
568.40,569.40,SPEAKER_02, So this is a real German wedding.
569.40,577.40,SPEAKER_02," But, and so he was saying we should come from, and one other person from our group is going because he hadn't gotten around to planning his vacation."
577.40,578.40,SPEAKER_02, So he's going to be there.
578.40,583.40,SPEAKER_02," So I thought, well, that's on the 12th and the other things on the 20th, you know, why not?"
583.40,588.40,SPEAKER_02," And then in between, I'm going to go down and see my relatives in, in, in, in, in, in."
588.40,589.40,SPEAKER_01," Oh, the 20th."
589.40,590.40,SPEAKER_01, That could be a...
590.40,591.40,SPEAKER_02," No, no, no, no."
591.40,593.40,SPEAKER_02, The 20th is my baptism.
593.40,594.40,SPEAKER_01, I saw.
594.40,595.40,SPEAKER_01, The wedding is 12th.
595.40,596.40,SPEAKER_02, But it's like a real thing.
596.40,603.40,SPEAKER_02," There's like a wedding at 11 and a lunch at, a schloss, cat figure, something at lunchtime."
603.40,609.40,SPEAKER_02," And then at seven o'clock there is, um, there is a Tiener dance."
609.40,612.40,SPEAKER_02," It, um, Gartre-Roba."
612.40,613.40,SPEAKER_01," Oh, God."
613.40,616.40,SPEAKER_02," But I thought you playing piano, you must have that."
616.40,618.40,SPEAKER_01, I haven't got a boba.
618.40,621.40,SPEAKER_02," Doesn't that mean, like, really fancy clothes?"
621.40,624.40,SPEAKER_01," Uh, well, yeah."
624.40,625.40,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
625.40,629.40,SPEAKER_01," She balled dresses and, you know, tuxedos and things."
629.40,630.40,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, I know."
630.40,631.40,SPEAKER_02, I couldn't believe it.
631.40,633.40,SPEAKER_02, Because I met when I was there on the other trip.
633.40,636.40,SPEAKER_02," I didn't, hadn't read the invitation before I didn't think I was going."
636.40,641.40,SPEAKER_02," And so I had met his name as Heiko for one day in Hamburg, we met."
641.40,642.40,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
642.40,645.40,SPEAKER_02, So he mentioned that he was looking for his tuxedo.
645.40,647.40,SPEAKER_02," And I said, you're going to get married in a tuxedo."
647.40,650.40,SPEAKER_02," He said, no, no, no."
650.40,654.40,SPEAKER_02," That evening, I've never heard quite a wedding."
654.40,656.40,SPEAKER_02, But so she wanted to follow up.
656.40,657.40,SPEAKER_01, Pardon?
657.40,659.40,SPEAKER_02," They said, if you really don't like those things."
659.40,666.40,SPEAKER_02," Well, but it's, you know, it's great meals."
666.40,668.40,SPEAKER_01," Really, free food."
668.40,673.40,SPEAKER_02," Aside from, we can talk and they should be nice people."
673.40,676.40,SPEAKER_02," It'll be, and then I'll know one more person."
676.40,677.40,SPEAKER_01," Whoa, that they."
677.40,680.40,SPEAKER_02," Oh, a little bit younger than us."
680.40,684.40,SPEAKER_02, He's probably a good question.
684.40,685.40,SPEAKER_02, I don't know.
685.40,686.40,SPEAKER_02, Maybe he's 32.
686.40,687.40,SPEAKER_01, That's okay.
687.40,688.40,SPEAKER_01, It's not like it's in a 21.
688.40,689.40,SPEAKER_01," Oh, no, no, no, no."
689.40,690.40,SPEAKER_02," This is, no, Frank."
690.40,691.40,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, spring."
691.40,692.40,SPEAKER_01, It's just here.
692.40,693.40,SPEAKER_02, Dr. Heiko Hecht.
693.40,697.40,SPEAKER_02," And yes, Eka, whatever her name is."
697.40,700.40,SPEAKER_02," Oh, they actually met in the United States."
700.40,709.40,SPEAKER_02," And I think the University of Virginia, where he's got his doctorate, or maybe snapper genius, it's somewhere over there."
709.40,712.40,SPEAKER_02, Something I don't know.
712.40,715.40,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, so they're not, you know, they're not really young."
715.40,716.40,SPEAKER_02, So they're friends.
716.40,718.40,SPEAKER_02," I presume, we're in the same age."
718.40,721.40,SPEAKER_02, I think they'll put a lot of family friends.
721.40,722.40,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I'm sure."
722.40,724.40,SPEAKER_01, It's always a way to always family.
724.40,731.40,SPEAKER_02," And the way he was talking, I guess, he's a very talented, sounds like, he's a voice family, is well to do or something."
731.40,738.40,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, well, if it's having a wedding, the album got a little bit, then it's going to be pretty."
738.40,740.40,SPEAKER_02, That's what I thought.
740.40,742.40,SPEAKER_02, That's what I thought.
742.40,743.40,SPEAKER_01, Up scale.
743.40,747.40,SPEAKER_02, And that.
747.40,748.40,SPEAKER_02, So think about it.
748.40,749.40,SPEAKER_02, I'll let you know.
749.40,750.40,SPEAKER_02, I'll let you think about that.
750.40,758.40,SPEAKER_02," And you can write me a note or give me a call because I know some people really hate weddings, but you're afraid to say no, or you have to think about it."
758.40,759.40,SPEAKER_02, But it's the 12th.
759.40,765.40,SPEAKER_02," And otherwise, what I'd like to try to do is they would use the 12th and 13th because it's weekend."
765.40,766.40,SPEAKER_02, We could see each other.
766.40,772.40,SPEAKER_02, And then I'll go Monday down to Bond or wherever my.
772.40,777.40,SPEAKER_02, Those relatives are because I haven't seen my uncle in like three or four years and he's just 2080.
777.40,779.40,SPEAKER_02, And I'm not missed the high food.
779.40,783.40,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, I guess it'll be summer, so it'll be in Bodminster, I fall."
783.40,785.40,SPEAKER_02, They've actually moved the old living bond now.
785.40,789.40,SPEAKER_02," They live in Bodnoina, which is I guess."
789.40,790.40,SPEAKER_02," But noina, I am."
790.40,791.40,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, just a little bit down."
791.40,793.40,SPEAKER_02, But I think they'll be in Winter Eiffel.
793.40,796.40,SPEAKER_02," And then my cousin, she still does live in Bond."
796.40,797.40,SPEAKER_02, So I'll get to see her.
797.40,804.40,SPEAKER_02, Then I'll zip off to Berlin to go to the sweating and see my favorite.
804.40,805.40,SPEAKER_02, Don't tell the other.
805.40,806.40,SPEAKER_02, I'll tell the other.
806.40,807.40,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
807.40,808.40,, Yeah.
808.40,817.42,SPEAKER_02," Because you see, when I was there before, I couldn't visit you because I didn't want to spend time visiting these other relatives in"
817.42,820.42,SPEAKER_01," Bob. So diplomatic about all of that, you know?"
820.42,825.40,SPEAKER_02," Well, I mean, if I was visiting you, it'd be very hard not to visit them."
825.40,830.40,SPEAKER_01," But the year before I wouldn't, I wouldn't tell on your, you know."
830.40,831.40,SPEAKER_02," I know, you wouldn't tell."
831.40,837.40,SPEAKER_02," But the year before I did it, but that's because we just stopped on the train and I had, you know, two hours."
837.40,840.40,SPEAKER_02, And we had our wild lunch.
840.40,841.40,SPEAKER_02, And on again.
841.40,842.40,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
842.40,845.40,SPEAKER_01, But we commiserated.
845.40,846.40,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
846.40,855.40,SPEAKER_02," But it sounds like you would have, you know, positive end result, which is, I don't know."
855.40,857.40,SPEAKER_01," I mean, it's a change."
857.40,858.40,SPEAKER_01, That's for sure.
858.40,859.40,SPEAKER_02, A change.
859.40,861.40,SPEAKER_02," And it is a lot of work, obviously."
861.40,862.40,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
862.40,864.40,SPEAKER_01," But you know, I really don't know if it's a lot of work."
864.40,866.40,SPEAKER_01, I always have to see that I'm just a terribly slow.
866.40,870.40,SPEAKER_01, I always should be doing these things much faster faster than I get them done.
870.40,872.40,SPEAKER_02," Well, so what if you're slow?"
872.40,875.40,SPEAKER_02," You know, look at it the other way."
875.40,880.40,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, but I always keep that, that's, that I was spending too much time that I should be doing other things."
880.40,881.40,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
881.40,887.40,SPEAKER_02," I just had this talk about somebody who was saying, you know, confirming, you know, and I know I'm too self critical."
887.40,889.40,SPEAKER_02, So it's not a good idea.
889.40,895.40,SPEAKER_02," Because I was complaining to them about my mother and they are the theory that, you know, what people do is a reflection of you."
895.40,912.40,SPEAKER_02," Because the woman had such a, that people react to you the reflection of you and what I mentioned about my mother bugging me was the fact that every time I see her or we even talked, she has to comment about my clothes or what I'm wearing."
912.40,920.40,SPEAKER_02," And I was talking to this woman because she seemed at such a good relationship with her mother, like her mother treated her like a human being and not a kid."
920.40,921.40,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
921.40,928.40,SPEAKER_02," And so she said, you know, you're mother's being critical, you know, you see that because you're critical to yourself too much."
928.40,931.40,SPEAKER_01," Well, you're filtering the information you get from her mother."
931.40,932.40,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, but this is ridiculous."
932.40,935.40,SPEAKER_02," I mean, she's never let up on that."
935.40,938.40,SPEAKER_02," I mean, it's crazy."
938.40,950.40,SPEAKER_02," You know, I don't, I mean, and I think, no, not the last time, the last time on the phone, I bugged her about something else that I been trying to not take anymore, but then she cries."
950.40,953.40,SPEAKER_02, But that doesn't work with me.
953.40,956.40,SPEAKER_02, Thank you for the sense of being mean.
956.40,960.40,SPEAKER_02, And I ignore the fact that she's crying.
960.40,962.40,SPEAKER_02, I'm pretty tough.
962.40,963.40,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
963.40,967.40,SPEAKER_01, I have a speaking crying.
967.40,974.40,SPEAKER_01," I have a colleague and American girl, a dancer, a school and a school and cologne."
974.40,976.40,SPEAKER_01, Cool.
976.40,980.40,SPEAKER_01, Somehow or other has fallen in love with me.
980.40,987.40,SPEAKER_01," And now that I'm leaving, going back to Jesus or she's all going crazy."
987.40,991.40,SPEAKER_01, And thinks she's concluded that I'm abandoning her.
991.40,995.40,SPEAKER_02," Oh, but it has been dark here."
995.40,996.40,SPEAKER_01, Pardon?
996.40,1000.40,SPEAKER_02," In America, we would say are you being stopped?"
1000.40,1001.40,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1001.40,1004.40,SPEAKER_02, And what is the reactions to Shannon?
1004.40,1005.40,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1005.40,1017.40,SPEAKER_01," She's nice, you know, but she's confusing the fact that I think that she's nice, the fact that, you know, she's found her made for the duration or whatever."
1017.40,1018.40,SPEAKER_01, I don't know.
1018.40,1025.40,SPEAKER_01," I mean, it's just, it's very uncomfortable for me."
1025.40,1028.40,SPEAKER_01, And we're going to have lunch tomorrow.
1028.40,1031.40,SPEAKER_01, I'm afraid it's going to get dramatic.
1031.40,1034.40,SPEAKER_02," I mean, that's not that far apart."
1034.40,1037.40,SPEAKER_02," You can still be friends here, you know?"
1037.40,1039.40,SPEAKER_01, She doesn't want to be friends.
1039.40,1040.40,SPEAKER_02, Oh.
1040.40,1042.40,SPEAKER_01, That's a problem.
1042.40,1044.40,SPEAKER_02, I don't want to be friends.
1044.40,1046.40,SPEAKER_01, I can be friends with anybody.
1046.40,1048.40,SPEAKER_01, Why is it well?
1048.40,1052.40,SPEAKER_02," I know, but I mean, even make an effort when it's harder to see each other."
1052.40,1053.40,SPEAKER_01," No, no, no."
1053.40,1054.40,SPEAKER_01, But that's the thing.
1054.40,1057.40,SPEAKER_01," She doesn't, you know, she's not content with being friends."
1057.40,1062.40,SPEAKER_01," She wants to, this is, she wants to get married."
1062.40,1065.40,SPEAKER_02," Oh, wow."
1065.40,1066.40,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1066.40,1068.40,SPEAKER_02, I'd like to let her on.
1068.40,1070.40,SPEAKER_01," Oh, are you crazy?"
1070.40,1077.40,SPEAKER_01," As I said, to be nice to her, you know, she got confused with, yeah."
1077.40,1084.40,SPEAKER_02," So, so the fact that you're moving on this other job just brings it to the the hand, right?"
1084.40,1085.40,SPEAKER_01, Exactly.
1085.40,1086.40,SPEAKER_01, She's being abandoned.
1086.40,1093.40,SPEAKER_02," Because I was presumed before then you would have let her know that, you know, she's nice and everything."
1093.40,1094.40,SPEAKER_02, But all of it.
1094.40,1099.40,SPEAKER_02, You just want to be friends even when you were working in the same place there.
1099.40,1100.40,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1100.40,1103.40,SPEAKER_01," Well, I mean, we've never been anything but friends."
1103.40,1105.40,SPEAKER_02," Well, I think you'll survive."
1105.40,1107.40,SPEAKER_01," Oh, I'll survive that's for sure."
1107.40,1115.40,SPEAKER_01," But as you were saying, you know, the trick doesn't work with you with peers, you know, that's, oh, the tears."
1115.40,1116.40,SPEAKER_01," The tears, yeah."
1116.40,1121.40,SPEAKER_01," So that's, I'm thinking about them and what's coming up, but it's in store for me tomorrow."
1121.40,1127.40,SPEAKER_02," Oh, I mean, it's not that tears aren't tough, but."
1127.40,1129.40,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I know, but I mean, you have to have a strategy."
1129.40,1130.40,SPEAKER_01, You don't have to be able to deal with it.
1130.40,1131.40,SPEAKER_02, That's true.
1131.40,1136.40,SPEAKER_02," I guess you look at them saying, they're actually the other person's reaction to the situation."
1136.40,1140.40,SPEAKER_02, They're not something you were doing.
1140.40,1141.40,SPEAKER_02, Right?
1141.40,1143.40,SPEAKER_02, That's how she might choose to react.
1143.40,1144.40,SPEAKER_01, Right.
1144.40,1145.40,SPEAKER_01, It's her problem.
1145.40,1151.40,SPEAKER_02," I know, but you know, you do want to help her with her problem."
1151.40,1152.40,SPEAKER_02, Right?
1152.40,1154.40,SPEAKER_02, Because you're friends.
1154.40,1156.40,SPEAKER_02, Can't be completely mean.
1156.40,1157.40,SPEAKER_01, No.
1157.40,1160.40,SPEAKER_02," But lunchtime, that's dangerous time to me."
1160.40,1162.40,SPEAKER_02, Is that because you're hoping that?
1162.40,1164.40,SPEAKER_02, But that's what I can only stand up.
1164.40,1167.40,SPEAKER_01," I can always stand up and say, I have to go back to work now."
1167.40,1168.40,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1168.40,1169.40,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
1169.40,1174.40,SPEAKER_02," Oh, that's cruel."
1174.40,1176.40,SPEAKER_02," Well, you'll survive."
1176.40,1181.40,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, the more stories to tell next time."
1181.40,1184.40,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, oh, that's true."
1184.40,1185.40,SPEAKER_02, It'll be exciting.
1185.40,1189.40,SPEAKER_02, You can tell me a perfect dinner conversation at the wedding.
1189.40,1190.40,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
1190.40,1193.40,SPEAKER_01, How I chilted my...
1193.40,1196.40,SPEAKER_02, Someone who I didn't even know was that.
1196.40,1197.40,SPEAKER_02, Right.
1197.40,1201.40,SPEAKER_02," Well, this not as bad as my story."
1201.40,1203.40,SPEAKER_02, Let's see.
1203.40,1205.40,SPEAKER_02, I was on this trip.
1205.40,1211.40,SPEAKER_02, I was meeting friends of mine who were on their honeymoon in Florida.
1211.40,1212.40,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1212.40,1214.40,SPEAKER_02, This woman friend had a friend in Florida.
1214.40,1215.40,SPEAKER_02, So it was a good opportunity.
1215.40,1216.40,SPEAKER_02, And I hadn't...
1216.40,1220.40,SPEAKER_02," Well, first of all, I hadn't seen the friend in a while."
1220.40,1221.40,SPEAKER_02, And I'd never seen Florence.
1221.40,1222.40,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
1222.40,1223.40,SPEAKER_02, Or the wedding got canceled.
1223.40,1225.40,SPEAKER_02, I would have seen her at the wedding.
1225.40,1226.40,SPEAKER_02, Never met the guy.
1226.40,1229.40,SPEAKER_02, So they called the wedding off a couple of weeks before.
1229.40,1231.40,SPEAKER_02, But the trip was still on.
1231.40,1233.40,SPEAKER_02," Is it tripped, you know?"
1233.40,1234.40,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1234.40,1236.40,SPEAKER_01, Why did they cancel the wedding?
1236.40,1239.40,SPEAKER_02, He got very cold feet.
1239.40,1242.40,SPEAKER_02," I mean, they still lived together and everything."
1242.40,1245.40,SPEAKER_02, But now I think they're talking about some of...
1245.40,1246.40,SPEAKER_01, Trying it again.
1246.40,1247.40,SPEAKER_02," Well, not that..."
1247.40,1250.40,SPEAKER_02," No, no, no, just what it is that gives him cold feet."
1250.40,1251.40,SPEAKER_02," Oh, therapy."
1251.40,1252.40,SPEAKER_01, Because it's not...
1252.40,1253.40,SPEAKER_02," Yes, it's not..."
1253.40,1254.40,SPEAKER_02, It's not her.
1254.40,1255.40,SPEAKER_02, It's just not yours.
1255.40,1256.40,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, I did."
1256.40,1257.40,SPEAKER_02, I didn't know.
1257.40,1258.40,SPEAKER_01," It's the idea of commitment, you know?"
1258.40,1259.40,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1259.40,1260.40,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1260.40,1261.40,SPEAKER_01, So...
1261.40,1262.40,SPEAKER_02, So they're going through that.
1262.40,1265.40,SPEAKER_02," But they were still going to do the trip, as she said, because we had..."
1265.40,1266.40,SPEAKER_02, We paid for it.
1266.40,1267.40,SPEAKER_02, We're both too cheap to give that up.
1267.40,1268.40,SPEAKER_02," Oh, yeah."
1268.40,1269.40,SPEAKER_02, That's right.
1269.40,1270.40,SPEAKER_02, Turn it into...
1270.40,1273.40,SPEAKER_01, That's kind of the tranican hour problem.
1273.40,1274.40,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1274.40,1278.40,SPEAKER_02," And so, because it was a bike trip in Italy plus a couple days in Florence."
1278.40,1279.40,SPEAKER_02, And so then we could...
1279.40,1280.40,SPEAKER_02, ...before I'm leaving for my trip.
1280.40,1282.40,SPEAKER_02," And I mean, there's your calls, me..."
1282.40,1284.40,SPEAKER_02," ...and tells me or email me, I guess."
1284.40,1295.40,SPEAKER_02," And says, she doesn't know if she can make it because her fiancé's father just got diagnosed with cancer."
1295.40,1296.40,SPEAKER_02, Which kind.
1296.40,1297.40,SPEAKER_02, Cancer in something.
1297.40,1298.40,SPEAKER_02, Liver in anywhere.
1298.40,1299.40,SPEAKER_02," Well, that's for you."
1299.40,1300.40,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1300.40,1301.40,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1301.40,1303.40,SPEAKER_02, And so that they had to find out about that.
1303.40,1304.40,SPEAKER_01, But she would let me know.
1304.40,1306.40,SPEAKER_01, And she would let me know.
1306.40,1307.40,SPEAKER_02, And she would let me know.
1307.40,1308.40,SPEAKER_02, And so they had to cancel the trip.
1308.40,1310.40,SPEAKER_02, That was a reason that you could get your money back.
1310.40,1313.40,SPEAKER_02, But she was hoping to come for a few days just on frequent flyer.
1313.40,1314.40,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1314.40,1318.40,SPEAKER_02," And then, you know, when I check my email on the trip, no, it's definitely..."
1318.40,1320.40,SPEAKER_02, ...she can't make it.
1320.40,1322.40,SPEAKER_02, It's just too crazy.
1322.40,1326.40,SPEAKER_02, And so then I end up going to Florence alone.
1326.40,1327.40,SPEAKER_02, Alone.
1327.40,1333.40,SPEAKER_02, But I only way looked up the person who's a friend of hers who I don't know.
1333.40,1337.40,SPEAKER_02," So, but that's the end with mine."
1337.40,1338.40,SPEAKER_02, But the beginning was here.
1338.40,1339.40,SPEAKER_02, She's a good wedding story.
1339.40,1342.40,SPEAKER_02, I'm going back to work.
1342.40,1345.40,SPEAKER_02, And I just keep telling my friend she needs to take a vacation.
1345.40,1347.40,SPEAKER_02, It doesn't matter.
1347.40,1349.40,SPEAKER_01, With whom and where?
1349.40,1350.40,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1350.40,1351.40,SPEAKER_02, Because it was so funny.
1351.40,1353.40,SPEAKER_02, She's such a workaholic when the wedding was off.
1353.40,1356.40,SPEAKER_02," First of all, she didn't even take off the day of the wedding."
1356.40,1358.40,SPEAKER_02," I said, you should just take that time back."
1358.40,1359.40,SPEAKER_01," Oh, God."
1359.40,1360.40,SPEAKER_01, Huh.
1360.40,1361.40,SPEAKER_02, You know.
1361.40,1362.40,SPEAKER_02, And then...
1362.40,1363.40,SPEAKER_02," Oh, it would be crazy."
1363.40,1365.40,SPEAKER_02," And she said about the trip, you know."
1365.40,1367.40,SPEAKER_02," She said, well, but it's so hard."
1367.40,1369.40,SPEAKER_02, I take that time for my trip tonight.
1369.40,1372.40,SPEAKER_02," She said when it was a honeymoon, you know, what could they say at work?"
1372.40,1375.40,SPEAKER_02," And I said, doesn't matter."
1375.40,1377.40,SPEAKER_02, But she didn't take it.
1377.40,1379.40,SPEAKER_01, And these are European?
1379.40,1380.40,SPEAKER_02," No, no, no."
1380.40,1381.40,SPEAKER_02, These...
1381.40,1382.40,SPEAKER_02," Oh, this is someone who lives in Boston."
1382.40,1384.40,SPEAKER_02, That's what it was so exciting to meet them because...
1384.40,1387.40,SPEAKER_02," ...to meeting Europe is kind of exotic, right?"
1387.40,1388.40,SPEAKER_02," No, these are not."
1388.40,1390.40,SPEAKER_02, These are crazy Americans.
1390.40,1391.40,SPEAKER_02, This is my investment.
1391.40,1392.40,SPEAKER_01," Oh, this is a workaholic America."
1392.40,1394.40,SPEAKER_01," Oh, they're just ordinary Americans, okay?"
1394.40,1395.40,SPEAKER_02, Ordinary.
1395.40,1396.40,, I have two.
1396.40,1399.40,SPEAKER_01, But then there are a lot of these are crazy.
1399.40,1400.40,SPEAKER_01, I have two.
1400.40,1401.40,SPEAKER_01, And European...
1401.40,1402.40,SPEAKER_01," I mean, European..."
1402.40,1404.40,SPEAKER_01," I mean, European, I would think like that."
1404.40,1405.40,SPEAKER_01, It has...
1405.40,1408.40,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, it's a rare species."
1408.40,1411.40,SPEAKER_01," I mean, it's something you don't find out here very often."
1411.40,1413.40,SPEAKER_02, I have lots of workaholic German friends.
1413.40,1416.40,SPEAKER_02, I have a couple visiting with me right now.
1416.40,1419.40,SPEAKER_01, But they're not there because they still work.
1419.40,1422.40,SPEAKER_02," Oh, no, but they're here for business."
1422.40,1424.40,SPEAKER_02, They're here for goodness.
1424.40,1425.40,SPEAKER_00," Okay, yes."
1425.40,1431.40,SPEAKER_02, And Sunday they had to keep some playing with me because they have to do a preparation for this talk on Tuesday.
1431.40,1433.40,SPEAKER_02, And that was crazy.
1433.40,1437.40,SPEAKER_02," And I have another friend of mine, Berlin's definite workaholic."
1437.40,1439.40,SPEAKER_02, So it's not.
1439.40,1444.40,SPEAKER_02, But it's completely self-induced.
1444.40,1448.40,SPEAKER_02, Is it supposed to hear that I think there's a lot more company pressure.
1448.40,1449.40,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, yeah."
1449.40,1451.40,SPEAKER_01, I suppose in Germany it's just personal...
1451.40,1452.40,SPEAKER_01, Of course it's personality.
1452.40,1454.40,SPEAKER_01, In America it's evil.
1454.40,1455.40,SPEAKER_01, You know.
1455.40,1456.40,SPEAKER_01, Capitalists.
1456.40,1457.40,SPEAKER_02," You look capitalist, yes."
1457.40,1458.40,SPEAKER_01, I know.
1458.40,1467.40,SPEAKER_02," Well, that was some study I was hearing on the radio the other day again about telling us how much time we've lost."
1467.40,1471.40,SPEAKER_02," How many more hours we worked and people did, you know, 30 years ago."
1471.40,1472.40,SPEAKER_02, Was it just...
1472.40,1473.40,SPEAKER_02," Probably, maybe it's..."
1473.40,1475.40,SPEAKER_01," I don't know, maybe it's even true."
1475.40,1477.40,SPEAKER_01, I think it's really true.
1477.40,1485.40,SPEAKER_02, This story was just saying about couples nowadays buying more services and why they did it.
1485.40,1488.40,SPEAKER_01, It was a higher standard of living.
1488.40,1489.40,SPEAKER_01, We have to afford...
1489.40,1493.40,SPEAKER_01," We have to finance somehow or other, which means we have to work harder to..."
1493.40,1495.40,SPEAKER_02, But we don't have to work...
1495.40,1496.40,SPEAKER_02, I mean...
1496.40,1500.40,SPEAKER_01, To finance the higher standard living.
1500.40,1506.40,SPEAKER_02," But we work harder just because they want to do everything with a smaller, you know, margin."
1506.40,1507.40,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1507.40,1509.40,SPEAKER_01," That's true, too."
1509.40,1512.40,SPEAKER_02," You know, more with less people."
1512.40,1513.40,, Right.
1513.40,1515.40,SPEAKER_02, So when they work more and more hours.
1515.40,1517.40,SPEAKER_02, But I've recovered from that.
1517.40,1525.40,SPEAKER_02, I was concerned last year as why I can take this vacation again because I'm still in my mode of...
1525.40,1527.40,SPEAKER_02," You know, what is my life?"
1527.40,1528.40,SPEAKER_02, It's not my work.
1528.40,1529.40,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1529.40,1530.40,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1530.40,1531.40,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
1531.40,1533.40,SPEAKER_02," I have the vacation, so I should be able to take it an August."
1533.40,1537.40,SPEAKER_02," So I don't know yet whether I'm coming, but I will let you know after Friday."
1537.40,1538.40,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
1538.40,1544.40,SPEAKER_01, Then you'll just have to give my machine a message because I will be somewhere between here and there.
1544.40,1545.40,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
1545.40,1550.40,SPEAKER_02, And then you think some more about this beautiful wedding.
1550.40,1553.40,SPEAKER_02, Where was a cat's fake cat's fake cat's fake cat's fake cat.
1553.40,1556.40,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, and one of the things is in schloss cats fake."
1556.40,1557.40,SPEAKER_02, I don't know.
1557.40,1559.40,SPEAKER_02, A lunch or the dance.
1559.40,1582.30,SPEAKER_02, A And so I do have to keep up the stereotype.
1582.30,1583.30,SPEAKER_02, So it's...
1583.30,1600.46,SPEAKER_02, For a three- polyester.
1600.46,1601.46,SPEAKER_02, It's pink.
1601.46,1602.46,SPEAKER_02, Light pink.
1602.46,1607.46,SPEAKER_02," But yes, I always known for my light colors even in the evening."
1607.46,1608.46,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1608.46,1609.46,, Yeah.
1609.46,1618.46,SPEAKER_02," See, we went into an outdoor concert here of our symphony on the 4th of July."
1618.46,1619.46,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1619.46,1621.46,SPEAKER_02, And I was surprised they all came in there.
1621.46,1625.46,SPEAKER_02," Official black outfits and all the women, you know, and black dresses."
1625.46,1627.46,SPEAKER_02, It's very black.
1627.46,1628.46,SPEAKER_02, Very...
1628.46,1632.46,SPEAKER_02," It was just, you know, outside in a park, got a makeshift stage."
1632.46,1634.46,SPEAKER_02, Just looked a little strange.
1634.46,1636.46,SPEAKER_02," Impressive, but then weird."
1636.46,1637.46,SPEAKER_02, But it was a very good concert.
1637.46,1639.46,SPEAKER_02, I guess we have a very good new conductor.
1639.46,1640.46,SPEAKER_02, And I definitely...
1640.46,1641.46,SPEAKER_02, He wasn't enthusiastic.
1641.46,1642.46,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1642.46,1645.46,SPEAKER_01, Did you do a lot of modern dance?
1645.46,1646.46,SPEAKER_01, Yes.
1646.46,1647.46,SPEAKER_01, Yes.
1647.46,1649.46,SPEAKER_02, And he also was very...
1649.46,1651.46,SPEAKER_02, Has a good rapport with the audience.
1651.46,1652.46,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1652.46,1653.46,SPEAKER_01, I mean...
1653.46,1654.46,SPEAKER_02, A showman.
1654.46,1655.46,SPEAKER_02, Yes.
1655.46,1656.46,SPEAKER_02, He really...
1656.46,1657.46,SPEAKER_02," Discussed the rhymes we have Leonard Bernstein, you know."
1657.46,1658.46,SPEAKER_02," Oh, yeah."
1658.46,1665.96,SPEAKER_02, Explaining the music to you and all this is a poster one who just is up there talking to his orchestra.
1665.96,1666.96,SPEAKER_02, I was impressed.
1666.96,1668.96,SPEAKER_02, I guess I'll have to go to the symphony here.
1668.96,1670.96,SPEAKER_02," He's only been here, like a year."
1670.96,1671.96,SPEAKER_02, He's from Russia.
1671.96,1672.96,SPEAKER_02, I don't know.
1672.96,1675.96,SPEAKER_02," Well, I guess I'll have to go in here and inside."
1675.96,1676.96,SPEAKER_02, Mm-hmm.
1676.96,1677.96,SPEAKER_02, Different acoustics.
1677.96,1679.96,SPEAKER_01, Here indoors.
1679.96,1680.96,, Okay.
1680.96,1683.96,SPEAKER_02," Well, I will let you get ready for bed."
1683.96,1686.96,SPEAKER_02, Because you've got to worry about your packing here.
1686.96,1692.96,SPEAKER_01," No, no, actually what I'm worried about is that if anybody goes over for dinner at eight o'clock tomorrow, it's Friday night."
1692.96,1693.96,SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.
1693.96,1700.96,SPEAKER_01, And I'm sitting here trying to figure out what I can serve for dinner when it's 30 degrees sound...
1700.96,1703.96,SPEAKER_01," I've said a great bit about, you know, 90 Fahrenheit."
1703.96,1704.96,SPEAKER_01, 90 degrees.
1704.96,1706.96,SPEAKER_02, I know how 30 is.
1706.96,1707.96,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1707.96,1712.96,SPEAKER_01, Without making me uncomfortable and making them uncomfortable.
1712.96,1718.96,SPEAKER_01," Anyway, the project tonight is to get everything all set up and get the house cleaned."
1718.96,1719.96,SPEAKER_00, Mm-hmm.
1719.96,1721.96,SPEAKER_01, And I'm still trying to...
1721.96,1726.96,SPEAKER_01, I'm still here in my living room sorting out the papers.
1726.96,1732.96,SPEAKER_01," So that my desk doesn't look like the third world, you know."
1732.96,1734.96,SPEAKER_02," Oh, well."
1734.96,1737.96,SPEAKER_02," Well, keep busy and wish you a good flight."
1737.96,1738.96,SPEAKER_02, Say hi to Nancy.
1738.96,1739.96,SPEAKER_01, Will do.
1739.96,1742.96,SPEAKER_01, And you give me a hint of how you're...
1742.96,1744.96,SPEAKER_02, I'll also know what's happening.
1744.96,1747.96,SPEAKER_02," But if I'm coming, you know, you have to work on the weather."
1747.96,1750.96,SPEAKER_02, I don't want bad weather that week.
1750.96,1751.96,SPEAKER_01, Oh.
1751.96,1756.96,SPEAKER_02," Oh, he says, oh no, now there's pressure."
1756.96,1759.96,SPEAKER_01," Well, I'll let all of my connections..."
1759.96,1760.96,SPEAKER_01, Right.
1760.96,1762.96,SPEAKER_02, You're closer to the top now.
1762.96,1763.96,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1763.96,1764.96,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1764.96,1765.96,SPEAKER_01, Who knows.
1765.96,1766.96,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
1766.96,1768.96,SPEAKER_02, So I'll call and give you a message.
1768.96,1771.96,SPEAKER_02, And hopefully I'll get to see you in August.
1771.96,1772.96,SPEAKER_01, Fine.
1772.96,1773.96,SPEAKER_01, Good.
1773.96,1774.96,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
1774.96,1775.96,SPEAKER_02, Bye-bye.
1775.96,1776.96,SPEAKER_01, Take care.
1776.96,1779.96,SPEAKER_01, And give me a call whether you're coming or not.
1779.96,1780.96,SPEAKER_01, And we'll figure it out somehow.
1780.96,1781.96,SPEAKER_02, All right.
1781.96,1782.96,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1782.96,1783.96,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1783.96,1784.96,SPEAKER_02, Good.
1784.96,1785.96,SPEAKER_01, Bye-bye.
1785.96,1786.96,, Bye.
