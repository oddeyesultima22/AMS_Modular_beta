19,21,SPEAKER_01, How can I going to help you?
21,28.48,SPEAKER_00," Alison, I'm calling because Comcast raised my rates again, and I don't understand why I have to pay more for the same service."
28.48,33.48,SPEAKER_00, It's $4 more for the exact same thing I had before.
33.48,34.48,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
34.48,35.48,SPEAKER_01, Can I get your name?
35.48,36.48,SPEAKER_00, Sally Walton.
36.48,39.48,SPEAKER_01, And your address.
39.48,42.48,SPEAKER_00, 1-2-2-5 Kentucky Avenue.
42.48,44.48,SPEAKER_00," Thornton, Colorado, 8-0-2-9."
44.48,47.48,SPEAKER_01, And the last four of your Social Security number?
47.48,48.48,SPEAKER_00, 1-2-3-4.
48.48,51.48,SPEAKER_01, Let me say you had a question about your bill or something?
51.48,52.48,SPEAKER_00, Yes.
52.48,55.48,SPEAKER_00, Comcast keeps raising my rates and I'm tired of it.
55.48,56.48,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
56.48,58.48,SPEAKER_01," Give me just a minute and take a look at your account, okay?"
58.48,59.48,SPEAKER_01, Can I put you on hold?
59.48,60.48,SPEAKER_00, Yes.
60.48,62.48,SPEAKER_01," Hey, Steve."
62.48,63.48,SPEAKER_01, That goes texting me.
63.48,65.48,SPEAKER_01, She wants to know if we're going to hang out tonight.
65.48,67.48,SPEAKER_01, We're going to play UNO or something.
67.48,68.48,SPEAKER_01, All right.
68.48,70.48,SPEAKER_01, Text me after that call.
70.48,71.48,SPEAKER_01, Thanks for holding.
71.48,72.48,SPEAKER_01, Sorry about that.
72.48,79.48,SPEAKER_01, So I just took a look at your account and it looks like you're in the preferred cable package with the HD box.
79.48,84.48,SPEAKER_01, And the HD went from $8 to $10 and your preferred package went from $16.95 to $18.
84.48,85.48,SPEAKER_01, Not that much.
85.48,89.48,SPEAKER_00, I don't understand why my rates keep getting increased.
89.48,94.48,SPEAKER_01," Well, the program rears the rates and they charge Comcast."
94.48,95.48,SPEAKER_01," So in turn, we have to charge you."
95.48,96.48,SPEAKER_01," All right, rates."
96.48,97.48,SPEAKER_00, You know what?
97.48,98.48,SPEAKER_01, But it's not that much.
98.48,99.48,SPEAKER_00, You know what?
99.48,100.48,SPEAKER_00, It is a lot.
100.48,101.48,SPEAKER_00, It's enough to me.
101.48,102.48,SPEAKER_00, I'm done with this.
102.48,103.48,SPEAKER_00, I'm tired.
103.48,104.48,SPEAKER_00, I'm frustrated.
104.48,105.48,SPEAKER_00, I'm going to go to satellite.
121.48,124.48,SPEAKER_01," Thank you for calling Comcast, Salus, and how can I help you?"
124.48,125.48,SPEAKER_00," Hi, Allison."
125.48,128.48,SPEAKER_00, I'm calling because Comcast has raised my rates again.
128.48,131.48,SPEAKER_00, I don't understand why I have to pay more for the same services.
131.48,134.48,SPEAKER_00, Can you tell me where this $4 is coming from?
134.48,135.48,SPEAKER_01, Sure.
135.48,136.48,SPEAKER_01, I do apologize for that.
136.48,137.48,SPEAKER_01, I'm going to definitely take a look at it.
137.48,139.48,SPEAKER_01, Can I just make sure that I have the right account up?
139.48,141.48,SPEAKER_01, Can I get you to verify your name and your address?
141.48,142.48,SPEAKER_00, Yes.
142.48,150.48,SPEAKER_00," It's Sally Walton, 1, 2, 5, 5 East Kentucky Avenue, Thornton, Colorado, 8, 0, 2, 2, 9."
150.48,151.48,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
151.48,154.48,SPEAKER_00," And my last four is 1, 2, 3, 4."
154.48,155.48,SPEAKER_01, Great.
155.48,156.48,SPEAKER_01, Thank you.
156.48,162.48,SPEAKER_01, I'm going to go ahead and pull up your last statement so we can review it together and see where that extra $4 is coming from.
162.48,163.48,SPEAKER_00, Thank you.
163.48,167.48,SPEAKER_00, It just seems like Comcast keeps raising the rates and getting really expensive.
167.48,169.48,SPEAKER_01, I can definitely understand that.
169.48,173.48,SPEAKER_01, Let's see what's going on with the billing concern.
173.48,179.48,SPEAKER_01," Looks like your services for your household, you have the preferred packet for the HD box."
179.48,180.48,SPEAKER_00," Yes, that's correct."
180.48,186.48,SPEAKER_01, And the rate for the HD went from $8 to $10 and the preferred package went from $16.95 to $18.
186.48,190.48,SPEAKER_01, So it's a difference of $3.50 from your last statement.
190.48,198.48,SPEAKER_00," Okay, but I just don't understand why it's $3.50 more or $4 for that matter, but none of my services are increasing."
198.48,200.48,SPEAKER_00, Just the prices.
200.48,201.48,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
201.48,202.48,SPEAKER_01, And let me ask you this.
202.48,207.08,SPEAKER_01, Have you been taking advantage of any of the free content that we offer with our on-demand or our Xfinity.com?
207.08,211.48,SPEAKER_00," Well, I watch the movies here and there, but that's about it."
211.48,212.48,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
212.48,223.08,SPEAKER_01," Because part of the reason why our rates have increased is because we have all these investments going into these new services so that we can offer our services to you where, when, and how you want them."
223.08,227.08,SPEAKER_01, Just making it easier for our customers so you can access the entertainment that you want when you want it.
227.08,228.08,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
228.08,230.08,SPEAKER_00, So I am getting more services then.
230.08,231.08,SPEAKER_01, Definitely.
231.08,232.08,SPEAKER_00," Oh, that's awesome."
232.08,233.08,SPEAKER_00," All right, Allison."
233.08,235.08,SPEAKER_00, That's all I was concerned about.
235.08,236.08,SPEAKER_00, Thank you for your time.
236.08,237.08,SPEAKER_01, You're welcome.
237.08,238.08,SPEAKER_01, You have a great day.
238.08,239.08,SPEAKER_00, You too.
239.08,240.08,SPEAKER_00, Bye.
240.08,241.08,SPEAKER_01," Bye bye,"
